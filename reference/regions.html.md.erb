The Fly.io platform runs applications physically close to users: in datacenters around the world, on servers we run ourselves. You can currently deploy your apps in 22 regions.

&#42; You can host your apps in any region; "Gateway" regions also have WireGuard gateways, through which you connect to your organization's private network.

## _Discovering your Application's Region_

You can see the list of Fly.io regions any time with [`fly platform regions`](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/platform-regions).

You can see which regions your app is running in with [`fly status`](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/status/).

View and manage your app's region pool with [`fly regions`](/docs/flyctl/regions/). See [Scaling and Autoscaling](/docs/reference/scaling/) for more about regions and scaling.

Fly.io [storage volumes](/docs/reference/volumes/) are tied to the region they're created in. 

When an application instance is started, the three-letter name for the region it's running in is stored in the VM's `FLY_REGION`  environment variable. This, along with other [Runtime Environment](/docs/reference/runtime-environment/) information, is visible to your app running on that instance.
