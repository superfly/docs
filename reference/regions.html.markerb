Fly.io runs applications physically close to users: in datacenters around the world, on servers we run ourselves. You can currently deploy your apps in 35 regions, connected to a global Anycast network that makes sure your users hit our nearest server, whether they’re in Tokyo, São Paolo, or Amsterdam.

&#42; You can host your apps in any region; "Gateway" regions also have WireGuard gateways, through which you connect to your organization's private network.

&#42;&#42; For some higher-demand regions we restrict scaling up Machines to organizations with the [Launch, Scale, or Enterprise plans](https://fly.io/plans).

## _Discovering your Application's Region_

You can see the list of Fly.io regions any time with [`fly platform regions`](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/platform-regions).

You can see which regions your app is running in with [`fly status`](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/status/).

[Fly Volumes](/docs/volumes/) and [Fly Machines](/docs/machines/) are tied to the region they're created in.

When an application instance is started, the three-letter name for the region it's running in is stored in the Machine's `FLY_REGION`  environment variable. This, along with other [Runtime Environment](/docs/reference/runtime-environment/) information, is visible to your app running on that instance.
