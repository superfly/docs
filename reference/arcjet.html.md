[Arcjet](https://arcjet.com) is a security layer that allows developers to protect their apps with just a few lines of code. Implement rate limiting, bot protection, email validation, and defense against common attacks.

Arcjet is installed as a dependency in your application and doesn't require an agent or any additional infrastructure. The SDK is currently available for JS applications, with support for other languages coming soon.

<aside class="callout">
This service is in **beta**. We consider it ready for production, but we may make breaking changes to the SDK. These will be announced in the [GitHub changelog](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/releases).

## Get started

A quick way to see what Arcjet can do is to deploy [the example app](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-example-nextjs-fly). It's also available at [example.arcjet.com](https://example.arcjet.com).

Clone the GitHub repository:

```cmd
git clone git@github.com:arcjet/arcjet-example-nextjs-fly.git
```

Set up a new Fly app:

```cmd
fly launch --no-deploy
```

This command will generate a `Dockerfile` and a `fly.toml` for you.

Create an Arcjet account and link it to your Fly app:

```cmd
fly ext arcjet create
```

This will:

* Create an Arcjet account linked to your Fly account.
* Create an Arcjet team mapped to your Fly organization.
* Create an Arcjet site for your Fly application.
* Set `ARCJET_KEY` as a secret on your Fly application.

Deploy to Fly:

```cmd
fly deploy
```

Open your app in your browser and try the features.

Review the request details in your Arcjet dashboard:

```cmd
fly ext arcjet dashboard
```

## Run locally

Arcjet protections run locally as well as when deployed to Fly. This makes it easy to test and debug security rules.

Assuming you have already cloned [the example](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-example-nextjs-fly) and linked Arcjet to your Fly app (see above):

Log into your Arcjet dashboard to get the `ARCJET_KEY` for your app.

```cmd
fly ext arcjet dashboard
```

Install dependencies:

```cmd
npm ci
```

Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and add your Arcjet key. If you
want to test the rate limiting authentication, you will also need to add an
Auth.js secret and [create a GitHub OAuth
app](https://authjs.dev/guides/configuring-github).

Start the dev server

```cmd
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Protecting your application with Arcjet

Once you have set your `ARCJET_KEY` secret, you can start using Arcjet to protect your application:

* [Bun](https://docs.arcjet.com/get-started/bun)
* [Next.js](https://docs.arcjet.com/get-started/nextjs)
* [Node.js](https://docs.arcjet.com/get-started/nodejs)
* [SvelteKit](https://docs.arcjet.com/get-started/sveltekit)

### Node.js example

You can also find this example [on GitHub](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/examples/nodejs-rl).

1. Install the Arcjet SDK:

    ```cmd
    npm i @arcjet/node
    ```

1. Add a rate limit to a route in `index.ts`:

    ```ts
    import arcjet, { tokenBucket } from "@arcjet/node";
    import http from "node:http";

    const aj = arcjet({
      key: process.env.ARCJET_KEY!, // Set as a secret on your Fly app
      rules: [
        // Create a token bucket rate limit. Other algorithms are supported.
        tokenBucket({
          mode: "LIVE", // will block requests. Use "DRY_RUN" to log only
          characteristics: ["userId"], // track requests by a custom user ID
          refillRate: 5, // refill 5 tokens per interval
          interval: 10, // refill every 10 seconds
          capacity: 10, // bucket maximum capacity of 10 tokens
        }),
      ],
    });

    const server = http.createServer(async function (
      req: http.IncomingMessage,
      res: http.ServerResponse,
    ) {
      const userId = "user123"; // Replace with your authenticated user ID
      const decision = await aj.protect(req, { userId, requested: 5 }); // Deduct 5 tokens from the bucket
      console.log("Arcjet decision", decision);

      if (decision.isDenied()) {
        res.writeHead(429, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
        res.end(
          JSON.stringify({ error: "Too Many Requests", reason: decision.reason }),
        );
      } else {
        res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
        res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello world" }));
      }
    });

    server.listen(8000);
    ```

1. Run your application:

    ```cmd
    npx tsx --env-file .env.local index.ts
    ```

Load the application and refresh the page a few times to see the rate limit in action.

## Pricing

Arcjet is currently in beta and is free to use. The current features available today will be unlimited and free to use. Our goal is to help developers protect their applications so we donâ€™t want you to incur costs if you are attacked.

Arcjet pricing will be based on the usage of features we intend to introduce in the future e.g. organization-wide rules, compliance tools, team management, etc.
