[Arcjet](https://arcjet.com) is a security layer that allows developers to protect their apps with just a few lines of code. Implement rate limiting, bot protection, email validation, and defense against common attacks.

Arcjet is installed as a dependency in your application and doesn't require an agent or any additional infrastructure. The SDK is currently available for JS applications, with support for other languages coming soon.

<aside class="callout">
This service is in **beta**. We consider it ready for production, but we may make breaking changes to the SDK. These will be announced in the [GitHub changelog](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/releases).

## Get started

To configure your application to use Arcjet, run this command from your Fly.io application directory:

```cmd
flyctl ext arcjet create
```

This will:

* Create an Arcjet account linked to your Fly.io account.
* Create a Arcjet team mapped to your Fly.io organization.
* Create an Arcjet site for your Fly.io application.
* Set `ARCJET_KEY` as a secret on your Fly.io application.

Use this command to open the dashboard for the Arcjet site associated with the current application:

```cmd
flyctl ext arcjet dashboard
```

## Protecting your application with Arcjet

Once you have set your `ARCJET_KEY` secret, you can start using Arcjet to protect your application:

* [Bun](https://docs.arcjet.com/get-started/bun)
* [Next.js](https://docs.arcjet.com/get-started/nextjs)
* [Node.js](https://docs.arcjet.com/get-started/nodejs)
* [SvelteKit](https://docs.arcjet.com/get-started/sveltekit)

### Node.js example

You can also find this example [on GitHub](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/examples/nodejs-rl).

1. Install the Arcjet SDK:

```cmd
npm i @arcjet/node
```

2. Add a rate limit to a route in `index.ts`:

```ts
import arcjet, { tokenBucket } from "@arcjet/node";
import http from "node:http";

const aj = arcjet({
  key: process.env.ARCJET_KEY!, // Set as a secret on your Fly app
  rules: [
    // Create a token bucket rate limit. Other algorithms are supported.
    tokenBucket({
      mode: "LIVE", // will block requests. Use "DRY_RUN" to log only
      characteristics: ["userId"], // track requests by a custom user ID
      refillRate: 5, // refill 5 tokens per interval
      interval: 10, // refill every 10 seconds
      capacity: 10, // bucket maximum capacity of 10 tokens
    }),
  ],
});

const server = http.createServer(async function (
  req: http.IncomingMessage,
  res: http.ServerResponse,
) {
  const userId = "user123"; // Replace with your authenticated user ID
  const decision = await aj.protect(req, { userId, requested: 5 }); // Deduct 5 tokens from the bucket
  console.log("Arcjet decision", decision);

  if (decision.isDenied()) {
    res.writeHead(429, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
    res.end(
      JSON.stringify({ error: "Too Many Requests", reason: decision.reason }),
    );
  } else {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello world" }));
  }
});

server.listen(8000);
```

3. Run your application:

```cmd
npx tsx --env-file .env.local index.ts
```

4. Load the application and refresh the page a few times to see the rate limit in action.

## Pricing

Arcjet is currently in beta and is free to use. The current features available today will be unlimited and free to use. Our goal is to help developers protect their applications so we donâ€™t want you to incur costs if you are attacked.

Arcjet pricing will be based on the usage of features we intend to introduce in the future e.g. organization-wide rules, compliance tools, team management, etc.
