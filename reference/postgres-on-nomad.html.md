[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), or PostgreSQL, is a powerful open-source object relational database system.

## About Fly Postgres

Fly Postgres is a regular Fly.io app, with an automated creation process and some extensions to simplify management. It relies on building blocks available to all Fly apps, like `flyctl`, volumes, private networking, health checks, logs, metrics, and more. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fly-apps/postgres-ha) to view and fork.

### About **Free** Fly Postgres

You can use Fly.io's [free resource allowance](https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/#free-allowances) in one place, or split it up. The following Postgres configurations fit within the free volume usage limit:

* single node, 3gb volume (single database)
* 2 x 1gb volumes (database in two regions, or a primary and replica in the same region)
* 3 x 1gb volumes (database in three regions)

If you want to keep your whole project free, save some compute allowance for your other apps.

See also [How to convert your not-free Postgres to free Postgres](https://community.fly.io/t/how-to-convert-your-not-free-postgres-to-free-postgres/3888).

## Creating a Postgres **app**

To create a Postgres cluster, use the `flyctl postgres create` command. The command will walk you through the creation with prompts for name, region, and VM resources.

```cmd
flyctl postgres create
```

```output
? App Name: c-pg-test
Automatically selected personal organization: Chris Nicoll
? Select region:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> ams (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
  cdg (Paris, France)
  dfw (Dallas, Texas (US))
  ewr (Secaucus, NJ (US))
  fra (Frankfurt, Germany)
  gru (São Paulo)
? Select region: mia (Miami, Florida (US))
For pricing information visit: https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/#postgresql-clusters
```

During this process, you get to choose from several preset resource configurations for the app:

```
? Select configuration:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> Development - Single node, 1x shared CPU, 256MB RAM, 1GB disk
  Development - Single node, 1x shared CPU, 512MB RAM, 10GB disk
  Production - Highly available, 1x shared CPU, 256MB RAM, 10GB disk
  Production - Highly available, 1x Dedicated CPU, 2GB RAM, 50GB disk
  Production - Highly available, 2x Dedicated CPU's, 4GB RAM, 100GB disk
  Specify custom configuration
```

The "Production" options give you a two-node cluster in a leader-replica configuration. A single-node "Development" instance can readily be scaled and [expanded to more regions](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/multi-region-databases/).

--> v0 deployed successfully

Connect to postgres
Any app within the personal organization can connect to postgres using the above credentials and the hostname "c-pg-test.internal."
For example: postgres://postgres:8a93cbc09798f3805056333072bd2b35be7eb634b13a05c3@c-pg-test.internal:5432

See the postgres docs for more information on next steps, managing postgres, connecting from outside fly:  https://fly.io/docs/reference/postgres/
```

After answering all the prompts, you'll see a message saying that the cluster is being created, followed by a deployment monitor watching as the app is launched. Take heed of the reminder to save your password in a safe place!

Your new Postgres cluster is ready to use once the deployment is complete.

Before we get any further, note that the automated Postgres creation process doesn't generate a `fly.toml` file in the working directory. This means that when you use `flyctl` commands with Fly Postgres apps, you'll have to specify the app, like so:

```cmd
flyctl <command> -a <postgres-app-name>
```

## Connecting to Postgres

How you connect to Postgres depends on the tools you're using. Connection string URIs are a common way to describe a connection to a postgres server.

Connection strings have the following format:

```
postgres://{username}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/{database}?options
```

The output from `flyctl postgres create` contains all the values you need to make a connection string to your database.

### Connecting to Postgres from within Fly

As a Fly.io application, your Postgres app is accessible through Fly [private networking](/docs/reference/private-networking/). This means applications within the same organization can look up the app at `appname.internal`. This name, when looked up, can return one or more IPv6 addresses.

### Connecting to Postgres from outside Fly
#### On a machine with `flyctl` installed

To connect to your Postgres database from outside your Fly organization, you need a WireGuard connection. However, `flyctl` on your local machine can connect using [user-mode WireGuard](/blog/our-user-mode-wireguard-year/) magic, without you having to set up your own WireGuard tunnel.

For a `psql` shell, you can just use the [`flyctl postgres connect`](/docs/flyctl/postgres-connect/) command:

```cmd
flyctl postgres connect -a <postgres-app-name>
```

You can also forward the server port to your local system with [`flyctl proxy`](/docs/flyctl/proxy/):

```cmd
flyctl proxy 5432 -a <postgres-app-name>
```

Then connect to your Postgres server at localhost:5432. Using `psql` again, as a trivial example, it would look like this:

```cmd
psql postgres://postgres:<password>@localhost:5432
```

If you already have something else listening on port 5432, you can run this instead:

```cmd
flyctl proxy 15432:5432 -a <postgres-app-name>
```

Then connect to localhost:15432.

As with all your Fly.io apps, you can get a root console on your app's VM using [flyctl ssh](/docs/flyctl/ssh/).

#### With your own WireGuard tunnel

If you have an active [WireGuard tunnel](/docs/reference/private-networking/#private-network-vpn) to your organization on our private network, you can connect to your Postgres cluster the same way you would from a Fly app within the same organization. For example, the following command would start an interactive terminal session on the cluster leader with `psql`:

```
psql postgres://postgres:secret123@appname.internal:5432
```

## Attaching an App to a Postgres app

Using the superuser credentials, you can create databases, users, and whatever else you need for your apps. But we also have the `flyctl postgres attach` shortcut:

```
flyctl postgres attach --app <app-name> <postgres-app-name>
```

When you attach an app to Postgres, a number of things happen:

* A database and user are created in the Postgres App. If the attached app is named "myapp", both the database and the user are named "myapp" too.
* The user is allocated a generated password.

When the Attached app starts it will find an environment variable `DATABASE_URL` set to a Postgres connection URI with the username, password, host, port and dbname filled in.

### Detaching an App from Postgres

Use `flyctl postgres detach` to remove postgres from the app.

```
flyctl postgres detach --app <app-name> <postgres-app-name>
```

This will revoke access to the attachment's role, remove the role, and remove the `DATABASE_URL` secret. The database will not be removed.

## High Availability

Fly Postgres uses [stolon](https://github.com/sorintlab/stolon) for leader election and streaming replication between 2+ postgres servers. It provides a number of things, including a “keeper” that controls the postgres process, a "sentinel" that builds the cluster view, and a “proxy” that always routes connections to the current leader.

5433 is the port the keeper tells postgres to listen on. Connecting there goes straight to Postgres, though it might be the leader or the replica. Since clients need writes, the proxy is listening on the default 5432 port so clients are connected to the current leader.

If the leader becomes unhealthy (eg network or hardware issues), the proxy drops all connections until a new leader is elected. Once it’s ready, new connections go to the new leader automatically. The previous leader's VM will be replaced by another VM which will rejoin the cluster as a replica.

**In general, your clients should connect to port 5432.**

## Users / Roles

A Postgres cluster is configured with three users when created:

- `postgres` - a role with superuser and login privileges that was created for you along with the cluster. Since the `postgres` role has superuser rights, it's recommended that you only use it for admin tasks and create new users with access restricted to the minimum necessary for applications
- `flypgadmin` - this role is used internally by Fly.io to configure and query the postgres cluster
- `repluser` - this is the user replica servers use for replication from the leader

You can view a list of users using `flyctl`

```cmd
flyctl postgres users list c-pg-test
```

```output
Running flyadmin user-list
USERNAME   SUPERUSER DATABASES
flypgadmin true      postgres
postgres   true      postgres
repluser   false     postgres
```

## Databases

One Postgres cluster can host multiple databases

### Listing Databases

You can view a list of databases with `flyctl`:

```cmd
flyctl postgres db list c-pg-test
```

```output
Running flyadmin database-list
NAME     USERS
postgres flypgadmin,postgres,repluser
```

## Connection Examples

### Connecting with Ruby ([docs](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg))

Ruby apps use the `pg` gem to connect to postgres.

```ruby
require 'pg'

# Output a table of current connections to the DB
conn = PG.connect("postgres://postgres:secret123@postgresapp.internal:5432/yourdb")
conn.exec( "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity" ) do |result|
  puts "     PID | User             | Query"
  result.each do |row|
    puts " %7d | %-16s | %s " %
      row.values_at('pid', 'username', 'query')
  end
end
```

### Connecting with Rails ([docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database))

Rails apps automatically connect to the database specified in the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

You can set this variable manually with `flyctl secrets set`
```bash
flyctl secrets set DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:secret123@postgresapp.internal:5432/yourdb
```

or by attaching the postgres database to your Fly app.


### Connecting with Go ([docs](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/wiki/Getting-started-with-pgx-through-database-sql))

`pgx` is the recommended driver for connecting to postgres. It supports the standard `database/sql` interface as well as directly exposing low level / high performance APIs.

First, add `github.com/jackc/pgx/v4` as a module dependency.
```bash
go get github.com/jackc/pgx/v4
```

The following program will connect to the database in `DATABASE_URL` and run a query.
```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"os"

	_ "github.com/jackc/pgx/v4/stdlib"
)

func main() {
	db, err := sql.Open("pgx", os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL"))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Unable to connect to database: %v\n", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	var greeting string
	err = db.QueryRow("select 'Hello, world!'").Scan(&greeting)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "QueryRow failed: %v\n", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	fmt.Println(greeting)
}
```

### Connecting with Node.js ([docs](https://node-postgres.com))

You'll use the `pg` npm module to connect to postgres from a node.js app.

```javascript
const { Client } = require('pg')
const client = new Client({connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL})

await client.connect()
const res = await client.query('SELECT $1::text as message', ['Hello world!'])
console.log(res.rows[0].message) // Hello world!
await client.end()
```

### Connecting with Prisma – Node.js ([docs](https://www.prisma.io/))

Prisma is an open-source object-relational mapper (ORM) for Node.js and works with both JavaScript and TypeScript. It consists of 3 components:
- Prisma Client - a type-safe query builder 
- Prisma Migrate - a data modeling and migration tool
- Prisma Studio - a modern intuitive GUI for interacting with your database


<details>
<summary>Set up Prisma in your project</summary>

Install the Prisma CLI and Prisma Client dependencies in your project

```
npm i --save-dev prisma
npm i @prisma/client
```

Initialize Prisma in your project:

```
npx prisma init
```
This command does the following:
- Creates a folder called `prisma` at the root of your project
- Creates a `.env` file at the root of your project if it doesn't exist
- Creates a `schema.prisma` file inside the `prisma` folder. This is the file that you will use to model your data

Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` to your PostgreSQL database
```
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:secret123@postgresapp.internal:5432/yourdb"
```

If you are working in a brownfield project, you can introspect your database to generate the models in your `schema.prisma` file:

```
npx prisma db pull
```

</details>

Assuming you have the following model in your `schema.prisma` file:

Add a model to your `schema.prisma` file:

```groovy
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider  = "prisma-client-js"
}

model Post {
  id       Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  content  String?
}
```

You can query your database using Prisma as follows: 
```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  const posts = await prisma.post.findMany()

  const newPost = await prisma.post.create({
    data: {
      title: 'PostgreSQL on Fly.io',
      content: 'https://fly.io/docs/reference/postgres'
    }
  })
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```

## Monitoring

### Status

You can use `flyctl status` to see a list of VMs and their status. The output for each VM includes it's role within the cluster.

```
$ flyctl status

### Logs

Fly Postgres apps run several processes inside each VM, including postgres, stolon keeper, stolon sentinel, stolon proxy, and postgres_export. Each of those processes redirect STDOUT and STDERR to logs which you can view with `flyctl logs`.

### Metrics

Fly Postgres apps export metrics to prometheus which can be seen in the Metrics UI or queried from grafana.

The available metrics are
```
pg_stat_activity_count
pg_stat_activity_max_tx_duration
pg_stat_archiver_archived_count
pg_stat_archiver_failed_count
pg_stat_bgwriter_buffers_alloc

## Scaling the Postgres Cluster

### Scaling Vertically - adding More VM Resources

You can change VM resources with the `flyctl scale vm` command:

```
$ flyctl scale vm dedicated-cpu-2x
Scaled VM Type to dedicated-cpu-1x
      CPU Cores: 1
         Memory: 2 GB

```

See [Scaling VM Resources](https://fly.io/docs/reference/scaling/#scaling-virtual-machines) for more.

### Scaling Horizontally - adding more replicas

```
flyctl volumes create pg_data --region syd --size 10
flyctl scale count 3
```

Replicas can be added in any region, but an instance outside the leader's region will be read-only. See [Multi-region PostgreSQL](/docs/getting-started/multi-region-databases/) for more.


## Upgrading the Postgres app

You can update a Postgres cluster, installed with `flyctl postgres create`, to the latest [release](https://github.com/fly-apps/postgres-ha/releases) using [`flyctl image update`](/docs/flyctl/image-update/).

Check your current image with [`flyctl image show`](/docs/flyctl/image-show/):

```cmd
flyctl image show -a <postgres-app-name>
```

And upgrade with:

```cmd
flyctl image update -a <postgres-app-name>
```

## Snapshots and restores

Fly.io performs daily storage-based snapshots of each of your provisioned volumes. These snapshots can
be used to restore your dataset into a new Postgres application.

### Listing snapshots

Snapshots are volume specific, so you will need to first identify a volume to target. You can list your volumes by running the `volumes list` command with your Postgres app name.

```cmd
fly volumes list -a <postgres-app-name>
```
```output
ID                   NAME    SIZE REGION ATTACHED VM CREATED AT
vol_x915grn008vn70qy pg_data 10GB atl    b780ce3d    2 weeks ago
vol_ke628r677pvwmnpy pg_data 10GB atl    359d0e24    2 weeks ago
```

Once you have identified which volume to target, you can go ahead and list your snapshots by running the following command:
```cmd
fly volumes snapshots list <volume-id>
```
```output
ID                  SIZE   CREATED AT
vs_2AjJ4lGqQwDbRfxm 29 MiB 2 hours ago
vs_BAARBQxZKl6JKU04 27 MiB 1 day ago
vs_OPQXXna6kA2Qnhz8 26 MiB 2 days ago
```
### Restoring from a snapshot

To restore a Postgres application from a snapshot, simply specify the `--snapshot-id` argument when running the `create` command as shown below:
```cmd
fly postgres create --snapshot-id <snapshot-id>
```
