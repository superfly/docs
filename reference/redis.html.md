[Upstash for Redis](https://docs.upstash.com/redis) is a fully-managed, Redis-compatible database service offering global read replicas for reduced latency in distant regions. Upstash databases are provisioned inside your Fly organization, ensuring private, low-latency connections to your Fly applications.

See the [What you Should Know](#what-you-should-know) section for more details about how Upstash Redis operates on Fly.io.

## Create and manage a Redis database

Creating and managing databases happens exclusively via the [Fly CLI](/docs/flyctl/install/). Install it, then [signup for a Fly account](/docs/getting-started/sign-up-sign-in/).

### Create and get status of a Redis database

<aside class="callout">
  If you're using Sidekiq, BullMQ or similar software, consider switching your database to a [fixed price plan](#fixed-price-plans) to avoid running up your pay-as-you-go bill.
</aside>

```cmd
flyctl redis create
```
```output
? Select Organization: fly-apps (fly-apps)
? Choose a primary region (can't be changed later) Madrid, Spain (mad)
? Optionally, choose one or more replica regions (can be changed later): Amsterdam, Netherlands (ams)
```

### The Upstash web console

To view more details about database usage, connection strings, and more, use:

```cmd
flyctl redis dashboard <org_name>
```

### List your databases and view status
Get a list of all of your Redis databases.

```cmd
flyctl redis list
```
```output
ID             	NAME               	ORG          	PLAN	PRIMARY REGION	READ REGIONS
aaV829vaMVQGbi5	late-waterfall-1133	fly-apps     	payg	mad           	ams
```

Note the database name, then fetch its status.

```cmd
fly redis status late-waterfall-1133
```
```output
Redis
  ID             = aaV829vaMVDGbi5
  Name           = late-waterfall-1133
  Plan           = Pay-as-you-go
  Primary Region = mad
  Read Regions   = ams
  Private URL     = redis://password@fly-late-waterfall-1133.upstash.io
```

### Connect to a Redis database

If you have `redis-cli` installed, you can connect directly to your Redis database and run commands.

```cmd
fly redis connect
? Select a database to connect to empty-water-3291 (sjc) 200M
Proxying local port 16379 to remote [fdaa:0:6d6b:0:1::3]:6379
127.0.0.1:16379> set foo bar
OK
127.0.0.1:16379> get foo
"bar"
127.0.0.1:16379>
```

### Update a Redis database

Upstash Redis instances can't change their primary region or name, but the following may change:

* Read regions
* Pricing plan
* Eviction settings

Use `flyctl redis update` and follow the prompts. Changing region settings doesn't cause downtime.

### Delete a Redis database

Deleting a Redis database can't be undone. Be careful!

```cmd
fly redis destroy my-redis-db
```
```output
Your Redis database my-redis-db was deleted
```

## What you should know

Your databases run within Fly.io infrastructure, but not inside your organization's network. So you're only paying Upstash pricing - not additional VM costs.

All Upstash Redis databases are replicated within the same region in a highly-available configuration. This means that hardware failures generally don't affect Upstash software, and therefore, your databases. Upstash also keeps regular backups of data in storage outside of Fly.io.

Once provisioned, the database primary region cannot be changed. However, replica regions can be added and removed at any time.

### Traffic routing

Upstash Redis is available in all Fly regions via a [private IPv6 address](/docs/networking/private-networking/#flycast-private-load-balancing) restricted to your Fly organization. Traffic is automatically routed to the nearest replica, or in the absence of nearby replicas, to the primary instance.

**If you plan to deploy in a single region, ensure that your database is deployed in the same region as your application.**

### Writing to replica regions

**Replicas forward writes to the primary**. Replicas can't be written to. Writes are synchronous, and synchronous writes over geographical distance experience latency. Plan for this latency in your application design.

If you're using Redis as region-local cache and don't require a shared cache, setup separate databases per-region and enable object eviction.

### Memory limits and object eviction policies

By default, Upstash Redis will disallow writes when the max data size limit has been reached. If you enable **eviction**, keys will be evicted to free up space.

First, keys marked with a TTL will be evicted at random. In the absence of volatile keys, keys will be chosen randomly for eviction. This is roughly the combination of the `volatile-random` and `allkeys-random` [eviction policies available in standard Redis](https://redis.io/docs/manual/eviction/).

Note that items marked with an explicit TTL will expire accurately, regardless of whether eviction is enabled.

## Pricing

Upstash offers a range of payment plans for different use cases.

#### Pay-as-you-go plan

Upstash Redis databases start on the pay-as-you-go plan at **$0.20 per 100k requests**. This means you only pay for what you use. For most use cases, this is a good starting point.

### Fixed price plans

Upstash also offers fixed price plans for when:

* You're using Sidekiq, BullMQ or similar pre-packaged software that uses Redis as a queue, that aggressively poll Redis
* You understand your Redis usage patterns and want a predictable monthly pricing

These fixed price plans are available via `flyctl redis update <dbname>`:

* Starter: $10 per month, single region only. Includes 200MB storage, 100 req/sec
* Standard: $50 per month, per region. Includes 3GB storage, 100 req/sec
* Pro 2K: $280 per month, $100 per replica region. Includes 50GB storage, 10k req/sec

Your usage is updated hourly on your monthly Fly.io bill. You can track database usage details in the [Upstash web console](#the-upstash-web-console) as well.
