<div class="callout">

The limited, "built-in" Redis caching that was previously known as Fly Redis is deprecated; we now recommend running Redis as a Fly.io app.

</div>

You can run a key/value store like [Redis](https://redis.io) or [KeyDB](https://keydb.dev/) on Fly.io.

Here's a quick procedure to  create a standalone Redis server as a Fly.io app in a single region, with persistent storage, and accessible only from apps within your organization.

## Create the Fly.io app

We have a sweet Redis image you can use to create your own Redis instances on Fly.io. Use `fly launch` to create the new Redis app, but don't deploy yet:

`fly launch --image flyio/redis:6.2.6 --no-deploy`

When prompted,  give the app a name (in this case `my-fly-redis`), and select a region. Let's use Chicago (`ord`) for this example.

The newly-generated `fly.toml` will specify the `flyio/redis:6.2.6` image:

```toml
[build] 
 image = "flyio/redis:6.2.6"
```

## Add persistent storage

We recommend adding a [volume](https://fly.io/docs/reference/volumes/) for persistent storage of Redis data. If you skip this step, data will be lost across deploys or restarts. The volume needs to be in the same region as the `my-fly-redis` app instance.

Here the volume is called `redis_server` and we use `fly volumes create` to put it in `ord` where the app is configured to deploy.

```cmd
fly volumes create redis_server --region ord
```
```output
       ID: vol_6d7xkrk7do64w2q9 
     Name: redis_server 
   Region: ord
      Zone: 2c30 
  Size GB: 10 
 Encrypted: true 
Created at: 03 Dec 21 21:47 UTC
```

## Tweak `fly.toml`

When we ran `fly launch`, it generated a `fly.toml` configuration file. We need to make some adjustments to it.

### Attach the storage volume

The following `[[mounts]]` section tells the new Redis app to mount the `redis_server` volume at `/data` when it starts.

```toml
[[mounts]]
  destination = "/data"
  source = "redis_server"
```

### Hook up metrics

Add [metrics](https://fly.io/docs/reference/metrics/):

```toml
[metrics]
  port = 9091
  path = "/metrics"
```

### Services

A default [[[services]] section](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/#the-services-sections) was generated on `fly launch` for internal port 8080. Redis doesn't use port 8080; additionally, it's unlikely that you want your public Redis exposed on the public internet.

So delete the `[[services]]` section.

Other apps within the same organization can still access the Redis server over the Fly.io [private network](https://fly.io/docs/reference/private-networking/), at `my-fly-redis.internal:6379`, but will not be mapped to the external internet.

## Add a password for Redis

This installation requires setting a password on Redis **before** deploying.

`fly secrets set REDIS_PASSWORD=MY_REDIS_PW`

<div class="callout">

Keep track of this password - it won't be visible again after deployment! More on `fly secrets`  [here](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/secrets/).

</div>

## Deploy

`fly deploy`

If all goes well (check with `fly status`), the new Redis server app `my-fly-redis` will now accept connections from your organization's other apps on the private IPv6 network, on the standard port `6379`.

## Test the Redis server

You can test the app with `fly ssh console`. Your Fly.io organization must have a root SSH certificate [established](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/ssh-establish/) in order to do this; check using `fly ssh log`.

Connect to `my-fly-redis`:

```cmd
fly ssh console -a my-fly-redis
```

```output
Connecting to top1.nearest.of.my-fly-redis.internal... complete
/ # redis-cli
```

Once in the `redis-cli`, authenticate. At that point you can run Redis commands interactively on the server.

```output
127.0.0.1:6379> auth MY_REDIS_PW
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> ping
PONG
```
