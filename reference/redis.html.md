[Upstash for Redis](https://docs.upstash.com/redis) is a fully-managed, Redis-compatible database service offering global read replicas for reduced latency in distant regions. Upstash databases are provisioned inside your Fly organization, ensuring private, low-latency connections to your Fly applications.

See the [What you Should Know](#what-you-should-know) section for more details about this service.

## Pricing

Upstash offers one free, resource-limited database per Fly organization. After that, all databases are billed by request count on a pay-as-you-go basis. Check the official [Upstash Pricing](https://upstash.com/pricing) page for details.

Note that empty responses are not counted towards your bill. This prevents billing for standard polling behavior of tools like [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/) or [BullMQ](https://bullmq.io/).

Your database charges will show up on your monthly Fly.io bill. You can track database usage details in the [Upstash web console](#the-upstash-web-console).


## Create and manage a Redis database

Creating and managing databases happens exclusively via the [Fly CLI](/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/). Install it, then [signup for a Fly account](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/).

### Create and get status of a Redis database

```cmd
flyctl redis create
```
```output
? Select Organization: fly-apps (fly-apps)
? Choose a primary region (can't be changed later) Madrid, Spain (mad)
? Optionally, choose one or more replica regions (can be changed later): Amsterdam, Netherlands (ams)
? Select an Upstash Redis plan:
> Pay-as-you-go
  Free
```

### The Upstash web console

To view more details about database usage, connection strings, and more, use:

```cmd
flyctl redis dashboard <org_name>
```

### List your databases and view status
Get a list of all of your Redis databases.

```cmd
flyctl redis list
```
```output
ID             	NAME               	ORG          	PLAN	PRIMARY REGION	READ REGIONS
aaV829vaMVQGbi5	late-waterfall-1133	fly-apps     	Free	mad           	ams
```

Note the database name, then fetch its status.

```cmd
fly redis status late-waterfall-1133
```
```output
Redis
  ID             = aaV829vaMVDGbi5
  Name           = late-waterfall-1133
  Plan           = Free
  Primary Region = mad
  Read Regions   = ams
  Private URL     = redis://password@fly-late-waterfall-1133.upstash.io
```

### Connect to a Redis database

If you have `redis-cli` installed, you can connect directly to your Redis database and run commands.

```cmd
fly redis connect
? Select a database to connect to empty-water-3291 (sjc) 200M
Proxying local port 16379 to remote [fdaa:0:6d6b:0:1::3]:6379
127.0.0.1:16379> set foo bar
OK
127.0.0.1:16379> get foo
"bar"
127.0.0.1:16379>
```

### Update a Redis database

Upstash Redis instances can't change their primary region or name, but the following may change:

* Read regions
* Pricing plan
* Eviction settings

Use `flyctl redis update` and follow the prompts. Changing region settings doesn't cause downtime.

### Delete a Redis database

Deleting a Redis database can't be undone. Be careful!

```cmd
fly redis destroy my-redis-db
```
```output
Your Redis database my-redis-db was deleted
```

## What you should know

Once provisioned, the database primary region cannot be changed.

### Traffic routing

Upstash Redis is available in all Fly regions via a [private IPv6 address](/docs/networking/private-networking/#flycast-private-load-balancing) restricted to your Fly organization. Traffic is automatically routed to the nearest replica, or in the absence of nearby replicas, to the primary instance.

**If you plan to deploy in a single region, ensure that your database is deployed in the same region as your application.**

### Writing to replica regions

**Replicas forward writes to the primary**. Replicas can't be written to. Writes are synchronous, and synchronous writes over geographical distance experience latency. Plan for this latency in your application design.

If you're using Redis as region-local cache and don't require a shared cache, setup separate databases per-region and enable object eviction.

### Memory limits and object eviction policies

By default, Upstash Redis will disallow writes when the max data size limit has been reached. If you enable **eviction** during creation on update, Upstash Redis will evict keys to free up space.

First, keys marked with a TTL will be evicted at random. In the absence of volatile keys, keys will be chosen randomly for eviction. This is roughly the combination of the `volatile-random` and `allkeys-random` [eviction policies available in standard Redis](https://redis.io/docs/manual/eviction/).

Note that items marked with an explicit TTL will expire accurately, regardless of whether eviction is enabled.
