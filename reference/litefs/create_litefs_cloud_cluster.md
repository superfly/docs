You can choose to create a LiteFS Cloud cluster, which will provide automatic
backups managed by Fly.io. With LiteFS Cloud, you'll have the ability to restore
your LiteFS database to any point in time near instantaneously. You can use LiteFS Cloud
to back up and restore your database running anywhere (whether you plan to run your
application on Fly.io, or somewhere else).

You can create your LiteFS Cloud cluster in the Fly.io dashboard. First,
[sign up for an account][Sign up] if you haven't already. After you're signed in,
navigate to the LiteFS Cloud section on the left navbar, and then use the Create button
to create a new cluster.
[Here's a handy link to the LiteFS Cloud dashboard][LiteFS Cloud Dashboard] if you prefer!

When you create your LiteFS Cloud cluster, you'll be asked to save an auth token.
Keep this handy - you'll use it below.

Just a note: if you decide not to create a LiteFS Cloud cluster right now,
you can always change your mind and add it later. Take a look at the
[LiteFS Cloud backup][] docs for more details.
