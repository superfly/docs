[Enveloop](https://enveloop.com) lets developers design, send, and track email and text messages from Fly applications using a simple API. They can store all message content, images, HTML, and CSS in Enveloop -- keeping Fly apps lightweight.

<aside class="callout">
This service is in **public beta** on Fly.io. A couple of notes:

Enveloop is a production service. For our Fly.io launch, we are in public beta as we tighten up the integration.

During the beta period, you wonâ€™t be charged for Enveloop usage.
</aside>

## Create an Enveloop project

Creating an Enveloop project happens via the [Fly.io CLI](/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/). Once the Fly.io CLI is installed, [sign up for a Fly.io account](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/) and create your first Fly app. From there, you can add an Enveloop project to your app.

<aside class="callout">Running the following command in a Fly app context (inside an app directory or specifying `-a yourapp`) will create a new Enveloop project and Fly Secrets (sandbox & production) on your app.</aside>

```cmd
flyctl ext enveloop create
```

```output
? Select Organization: moon (moon)
? Choose a name, use the default, or leave blank to generate one:
Your Enveloop project (quiet-butterfly-6638) is ready. See details and next steps with:

Setting the following secrets on quiet-butterfly-6638:
ENVELOOP_LIVE_API_KEY: live_**********
ENVELOOP_SANDBOX_API_KEY: test_**********
```

## The Enveloop Web Console

Enveloop provides a visual display of your message templates, a template builder, and message logging and monitoring. To access these features, use the `dashboard` command to launch the Enveloop web app:

```cmd
flyctl ext enveloop dashboard <project_name>
```

## Pricing and Billing

<aside class="callout">
During the public beta, Enveloop is free to use on Fly.io. 
</aside>

Enveloop starts at $5 per month. With that, we include 1000 messages per month -- each message over 1000 is $0.005. As you send more messages, individual messages sent cost less -- the breakdown below illustrates. While we only charges for messages (email or text) sent, the $5 minimum helps cover logging, data retention, and support. You can view the official [Enveloop Pricing](https://enveloop.com/pricing) page for additional information.
