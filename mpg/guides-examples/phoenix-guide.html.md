This guide explains the key **Managed Postgres (MPG)-specific adjustments** you need when connecting a Phoenix app. We'll focus on:

1. Connection Pooling Settings
2. Running Migrations
3. Using Oban with MPG
4. Troubleshooting and Common Issues

This guide doesn’t cover Phoenix or Ecto setup—we assume you already have that in place.

## Connection Pooling with PgBouncer + Ecto

Fly.io MPG uses [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) for connection pooling. By default, MPG clusters run in **Session** mode but Ecto requires **Transaction** mode due to how it handles connection pooling.

To configure PgBouncer:

1. Open your MPG cluster in the dashboard.
2. Go to **Connect → Pooler settings**.
3. Set **Pool mode** to **Transaction**.

You'll also need to update your repo config:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  url: System.fetch_env!("DATABASE_URL"),
  pool_size: 8,
  timeout: 15_000,
  prepare: :unnamed
```

`prepare: :unnamed` is required because named prepared statements don't work with PgBouncer in transaction mode.

## Running Migrations

While you'll need to use Transaction mode with Ecto for most cases, Migrations are a special case. Migrations rely on [advisory locks](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS) and session stickiness, which PgBouncer's [transaction pooling mode](https://www.pgbouncer.org/usage.html#pool-modes) doesn't support. For running migrations you'll need to configure your app to use the **direct database URL** instead.

Update your secrets to add a `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`

```bash
fly secrets set \
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://...@pgbouncer.<cluster>.flympg.net/fly-db" \
  DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://...@direct.<cluster>.flympg.net/fly-db"
```

In your fly.toml, update your release command to use the direct connection for running your migration:

```toml
[deploy]
  release_command = "/bin/sh -lc 'DATABASE_URL=$DIRECT_DATABASE_URL bin/migrate'"
```

Or run a migration manually:

```bash
fly ssh console -C '/bin/sh -lc "DATABASE_URL=\"$DIRECT_DATABASE_URL\" bin/migrate"'
```

## Using Oban with MPG

If you're using the [Oban library](https://hexdocs.pm/oban/Oban.html) for handling Job queues, you'll need to make a few adjustments as PgBouncer in transaction mode doesn't support `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, which Oban uses for job notifications. You have a few options:

### 1. Use a non-Postgres notifier

```elixir
# Distributed Erlang notifier
config :my_app, Oban,
  repo: MyApp.ObanRepo,
  notifier: Oban.Notifiers.PG,
  queues: [default: 10]
```

Or with Phoenix PubSub:

```elixir
config :my_app, Oban,
  repo: MyApp.ObanRepo,
  notifier: {Oban.Notifiers.Phoenix, pubsub: MyApp.PubSub},
  queues: [default: 10]
```

### 2. Run Oban on a direct connection

If you have a requirement to use Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, you can set up Oban to use a direct database connection instead of using PG Bouncer

```elixir
config :my_app, Oban,
  repo: MyApp.DirectRepo,
  notifier: Oban.Notifiers.Postgres,
  queues: [default: 10]
```

This uses direct DB connections. Each connection is an Ecto pool entry that bypasses PgBouncer. Because direct connections are limited, keep the pool very small.

### 3. Legacy fallback (Oban < 2.14)

Older versions required the Repeater plugin. Since Oban 2.14 (2023), polling fallback is built-in and Repeater is deprecated.

## Troubleshooting and common errors

### Troubleshooting checklist

- Set PgBouncer pool mode to Transaction.
- Set `prepare: :unnamed` on every Repo.
- Use the pooled URL for app traffic and the direct URL for migrations and other session-scoped operations (advisory locks, etc.).
- Keep Ecto pools modest on the Basic plan (API repo 8, Oban repo 6). Reduce if most connections sit idle.
- Check MPG metrics around error timestamps for restarts or memory pressure.

### Common errors and fixes

- `tcp recv (idle): closed` or `tcp recv (idle): timeout` — These are idle connection reclaimed by the pooler, and don't represent an issue as Ecto reconnects automatically. To remove them, lower your pool size or ignore.
- `FATAL 08P01 protocol_violation` on login — Set `prepare: :unnamed` and ensure PgBouncer is in Transaction mode.
- Oban jobs not running — Use a non-Postgres notifier (PG or Phoenix) behind PgBouncer, or run Oban on a direct Repo. On Oban ≥ 2.14, do not add Repeater (polling fallback is automatic when PubSub isn't available).
- Migrations hanging or failing — Run migrations with the direct database URL (via `release_command` or a one-off SSH command), not through PgBouncer.
