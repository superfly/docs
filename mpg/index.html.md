Fly.io's Managed Postgres is our fully-managed database service that handles all aspects of running production PostgreSQL databases. We manage backups, high availability, failover, security patches, version upgrades, and performance optimization, while you focus on your application. Each cluster includes a primary and replica behind a proxy for automatic failover, with storage that auto-grows up to 1TB.
