## What is Managed Postgres?

Fly.io's Managed Postgres is our fully-managed database service that handles all aspects of running production PostgreSQL databases where we take care of:

- Automatic backups and recovery
- High availability with automatic failover
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Resource scaling (CPU, RAM, storage)
- 24/7 support and incident response
- Automatic encryption of data at rest and in transit

### What's included

You'll be able to access:

- A highly-available Postgres cluster within your Fly.io organization's [private network](/docs/networking/private-networking/)
- A single database on that cluster
- Fly.io Support Portal to log tickets and get help
- Any modules and extensions included in the [default Postgres 16 distribution](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/contrib.html)
- The third party `pgvector` extension for vector similarity search, if enabled when provisioning your database
- The third party `PostGIS` extension for adding geospatial data support, if enabled when provisioning your database

### What's not there yet

At the moment, the following features are under development:

- Security patches and version upgrades
- Multiple databases or schemas per cluster
- Third Party Postgres extensions besides `pgvector` or `postGIS`
- Customer-facing monitoring and alerting
- Database migration tools

We're working on expanding these capabilities and will provide updates as they become available.
