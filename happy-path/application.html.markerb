Your application is running by default on two [Machines](https://fly.io/docs/machines/).

Don't worry about cost.  Both machines stop when not in use, and [autostart](https://fly.io/docs/launch/autostop-autostart/) when a new request comes in.
This is entirely configurable.  You can chose to [suspend](https://community.fly.io/t/new-feature-in-preview-suspend-resume-for-machines/20672) instead of stop,
configure a [minimum number](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/#the-http_service-section) of machines to leave running, or even decide never to
stop at all.

Familiarize yourself with [fly.toml](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/).  Make a change there -- or in fact to any part of your application -- and run `fly deploy`.

The purpose of two machines is twofold: redundancy and scalability. If the machine hosting one goes down, the other can continue on. If both are available, in times of high use both can be started to handle requests.
You can [vertically scale](https://fly.io/docs/launch/scale-machine/) the CPU and RAM on each machine.

You can also [horizontally scale](https://fly.io/docs/launch/scale-count/) to more machines.  Be sure to scroll down on that page far enough to see how to scale to
multiple [regions](https://fly.io/docs/reference/regions/).  If you have a co-worker on another continent, create a machine there.

And all this is made possible by [Anycast](https://fly.io/docs/networking/services/), a [load balancing proxy](https://fly.io/docs/reference/fly-proxy/), and [DNS certificates](https://fly.io/docs/networking/custom-domain/).
Be sure to read the last link if you are interested in custom domains.
