[Upstash Redis](https://fly.io/docs/reference/redis/) is used by this application for its [pubsub](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/?group=pubsub)
capabilities, but it can do [so much more](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/rediscompatibility).

In this application, updates are broadcast to all machines via Redis, and then each machine informs browser clients
of the update via [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).  Client the request
updated information from the application using HTTP GET.
