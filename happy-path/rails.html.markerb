The Rails source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/fly-apps/rails-dictaphone/).
`fly launch` will provide a [`Dockerfile`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/)
 and a [`fly.toml`](/docs/reference/configuration/) config file.  `fly launch` will
 also work with Rails-provided Dockerfiles. When you make changes to your application, you can run
 `bin/rails generate dockerfile` to generate updated Dockerfiles.

How the pieces are put together:

* The original web-dictaphone app distributed throughout the application:
    * [`app/javascript/controllers/main_controls_controller`](https://github.com/fly-apps/rails-dictaphone/blob/main/app/javascript/controllers/main_controls_controller.js)
      and [`app/javascript/controllers/sound_clip_controller`](https://github.com/fly-apps/rails-dictaphone/blob/main/app/javascript/controllers/sound_clip_controller.js)
      contain the JavaScript, implemented as [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/handbook/origin) controllers.
    * [`app/assets/stylesheets/dictaphone.css`](https://github.com/fly-apps/rails-dictaphone/blob/main/app/assets/stylesheets/dictaphone.css) contains
      the stylesheets.
    * [`app/views/clips/index.html.erb`](https://github.com/fly-apps/rails-dictaphone/blob/main/app/views/clips/index.html.erb) contains the HTML
* [Active Record](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) will run using Sqlite3 as the database in development mode, and
PostgreSQL in production.
  Access to the database is through the `DATABASE_URL` secret.
* [Active Storage](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) is configured to write to the filesystem
  in development and Tigris in production.  The following secrets are used to
  establish the connection: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `BUCKET_NAME`.
* [Action Cable](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html) is configured to use an Async adapter
  in development and the Redis adapter in production.

Key points of logic:

* [`app/controllers/clips_controller.rb`](https://github.com/fly-apps/rails-dictaphone/blob/main/app/controllers/clips_controller.rb) contains
  the logic to build responses to requests for the index page, and to GET, PUT,
  and DELETE audio clips.
* The realtime implementation code is primarily in [ActionCable](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html), so all that is needed is one line in [`app/models/clip.rb`](https://github.com/fly-apps/rails-dictaphone/blob/6bdf4f639640c9fb55530546dbbed682b65a7df9/app/models/clip.rb#L2)
and one line in [`app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`](https://github.com/fly-apps/rails-dictaphone/blob/6bdf4f639640c9fb55530546dbbed682b65a7df9/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb#L9)
* When the `WHISPER_URL` secret is set, `PUT` requests will cause the audio clips
  to be passed to the Whisper server, and responses will be used to update the
  PostgreSQL database.  This is done using [Active Job](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html)
  and [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/).
  The code for this is in [`app/jobs/whisper_transcribe_job.rb`](https://github.com/fly-apps/rails-dictaphone/blob/main/app/jobs/whisper_transcribe_job.rb).
