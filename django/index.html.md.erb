Fly is a great place to run Django applications. Getting an application running on Fly.io is essentially working out how to package it as a deployable image that can be deployed to the Fly.io global application platform for a fast, snappy, low-latency experience.

If you have questions or comments, please reach out on the [Django category of the Community Board](https://community.fly.io/c/django/) for Django on Fly.io specific discussions. The general [Community Board](https://community.fly.io/) is great for all things Fly.io like networking, databases, regions, and more. You can use the `django` tag as well to help interested people find a topic more easily.

## [Getting Started](./getting-started)

Run through the [Starter Django App](./getting-started/) guide to get a feel for what it's like to deploy to Fly. You'll have a Django app running in just a few minutes.

## [Existing Django Apps](./getting-started/existing/)

The [Existing Django Apps](./getting-started/existing/) guide walks through deploying a production-ready project to Fly. If you are coming from another hosting platform like Heroku there are additional tips for managing the migration.
