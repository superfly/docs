Fly is a great place to run Django applications. You can quickly deploy on Fly's dedicated global servers close to your users for a fast, snappy, low-latency experience.

If you have any questions or comments, please do so on the [Fly Community Board]((https://community.fly.io/) and tag your topic with `django` to ensure that it gets seen by the right people.

## [Getting Started](./getting-started)

Run through the [Starter Django App](./getting-started/) guide to get a feel for what it's like to deploy to Fly. You'll have a Django app running in just a few minutes.
