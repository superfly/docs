Getting an application running on Fly.io is essentially working out how to package it as a deployable image. Once packaged it can be deployed to the Fly.io global application platform.

In this guide we'll learn how to deploy a [Laravel](https://www.djangoproject.com/) application on Fly.io.

If you have questions or comments, please reach out on the [Community Board](https://community.fly.io/) and tag your topic with `django` to ensure that it gets seen by the right people.

## [Getting Started](./getting-started)

Run through the [Starter Django App](./getting-started/) guide to get a feel for what it's like to deploy to Fly. You'll have a Django app running in just a few minutes.
