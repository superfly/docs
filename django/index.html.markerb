Fly.io is a great place to run your Django application. `fly launch` can detect, configure and deploy Django apps.

If you have questions or comments, please reach out on the [Django category of the Community Board](https://community.fly.io/c/django/) for Django on Fly.io specific discussions. The general [Community Board](https://community.fly.io/) is great for all things Fly.io: networking, databases, regions, and more. You can use the `django` tag as well to help interested people find a topic more easily.
