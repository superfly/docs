You might want to move an app to a new org to hand off your completed work to a client, to take advantage of a new pricing model, or to move a production app out of your personal organization.

You can move an entire app with its resources to another organization with the `fly apps move` command. You'll need to be a member of both organizations to move an app.

To move an app from one organization to another:

```cmd
fly apps move <app name> --org <target organization name>
```

<div class="important">
**Fly Postgres:** You can't use the `fly apps move` command for Fly Postgres apps. To move a Postgres app to another organization, create a new Postgres app under the target organization, and then [restore the data from your current Postgres app volume snapshot](/docs/postgres/managing/backup-and-restore/#restoring-from-a-snapshot).
</div>

## App downtime

Your app will have up to a few minutes of downtime while the move operation completes.

## Resources moved with the app

The following app resources are transferred to the new org automatically:

- Fly Machines and Fly Volumes (including data)
- environment variables and secrets
- certificates and domain names
- LiteFS databases (when `$FLY_APP_NAME` is used for your Consul key in `litefs.yml`)
- Tigris object storage

## Resources that you need to manually reconfigure

The following extension services need to be reconfigured for the app after the move:

- **[Upstash for Redis](https://fly.io/docs/reference/redis/):** Upstash Redis is only available over an organization's private network. After you move the app, you'll need to provision a new database for the new org.
