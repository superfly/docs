<div class="callout">
This feature only works for V2 Apps running on Fly Machines. You might also be interested in learning about [scaling the number of machines](/docs/apps/scale-count/) for the V2 Apps Platform. For information about scaling V1 Apps, refer to [Scale V1 Nomad Apps](/docs/apps/legacy-scaling/).
</div>

Fly Machines are fast to start and stop, and you don't pay for their CPU and RAM when they're in the `stopped` state. For Fly Apps with a service configured, Fly Proxy can automatically start and stop existing Machines based on incoming requests, so that your app can meet demand without keeping extra Machines running. And if your app needs to have one or more Machines always running in your primary region, then you can set a minimum number of machines to keep running.

This Fly Proxy feature also plays well with apps whose Machines [exit from within](#stop-a-machine-by-terminating-its-main-process) when idle. If your app already shuts down when idle, then the proxy can restart it when there's traffic.

## Configure automatic start and stop

The autostart and stop settings apply per service, so you set them within the [[[services]]](/docs/reference/configuration/#the-services-sections) or [[http_service]](/docs/reference/configuration/#the-http_service-section) sections of `fly.toml`. You can configure automatic starts and stops separately with the `auto_start_machines` and `auto_stop_machines` settings, and set the minimum number of machines to keep running with the `min_machines_running` setting.

Concurrency limits for services affect [how automatic starts and stops work](#how-it-works).

### Default and recommended values

Default settings in `fly.toml` for V2 Apps created using the `fly launch` command:

```toml
...
[[services]]
  internal_port = 8080
  protocol = "tcp"
  auto_stop_machines = true
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0
...
```

```toml
...
[http_service]
  internal_port = 8080
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = true
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0
...
```

<div class="callout">
Existing V2 Apps&mdash;or any V2 Apps that don't have these settings in `fly.toml`&mdash;have the default values `auto_start_machines = true` and `auto_stop_machines = false`.
</div>

In general, we recommend setting `auto_stop_machines` and `auto_start_machines` to the same value to avoid having Machines that either never start or never stop. 

If `auto_start_machines = true` and `auto_stop_machines = false`, then Fly Proxy will automatically start your Machines but will never stop them. This means you'll have to stop Machines manually, or have your [app exit when idle](#stop-a-machine-by-terminating-its-main-process).

If `auto_start_machines = false` and `auto_stop_machines = true`, then Fly Proxy will automatically stop your Machines when there's low traffic, but won't be able to start them again. If all or most of your Machines are stopped, then requests to your app will start failing.

You can set `min_machines_running` to `1` or higher if you need at least one instance of your app running all the time. This setting is for the total number of Machines, not Machines per region. For example, if `min_machines_running = 1`, then your app will scale down until there is only one Machine running in your primary region. 

There's no "maximum machines running" setting, because the maximum number of Machines is just the total number of Machines you've created for your app. Learn more in the [How It Works](#how-it-works) section.

## How It Works

The Fly Proxy runs a process to automatically stop and start existing Fly Machines every few minutes.

<div class="callout">
The automatic start and stop feature only works on existing Machines and never creates or destroys Machines for you. The maximum number of running Machines is the number of Machines you've created for your app using `fly scale count` or `fly machine clone`. Learn more about [scaling the number of Machines](/docs/apps/scale-count/). 
</div>

### Fly Proxy Stops Machines

When `auto_stop_machines = true` in your `fly.toml`, the proxy looks at Machines running in a single region and uses the concurrency [`soft_limit` setting](/docs/reference/configuration/#the-http_service-section) for each Machine to determine if there's excess capacity. If the proxy decides there's excess capacity, it stops exactly one machine. The proxy repeats this process every few minutes, stopping only one machine per region, if needed, each time.

If you have the [`kill_signal` and `kill_timeout` options](/docs/reference/configuration/#runtime-options) configured in your `fly.toml` file, then Fly Proxy uses those settings when it stops a Machine.

Fly Proxy determines excess capacity per region as follows:

* If there's more than one Machine in the region:
  * the proxy determines how many running Machines are over their `soft_limit` setting and then calculates excess capacity: `excess capacity = num of machines - (num machines over soft limit + 1)`
  * if excess capacity is 1 or greater, then the proxy stops one Machine
* If there's only one Machine in the region:
  * the proxy checks if the Machine has any traffic
  * if the Machine has no traffic (a load of 0), then the proxy stops the Machine

### Fly Proxy Starts Machines

When `auto_start_machines = true` in your `fly.toml`, the Fly Proxy restarts a Machine in the nearest region when required.

Fly Proxy determines when to start a Machine as follows:

* The proxy waits for a request to your app.
* If all the running Machines are above their `soft_limit` setting, then the proxy starts a stopped Machine in the nearest region (if there are any stopped Machines).
* The proxy routes the request to the newly started Machine.

## When to Stop and Start Fly Machines Automatically, or Not

If your app has highly variable request workloads, then you can set `auto_stop_machines` and `auto_start_machines` to `true` to manage your Fly Machines as demand decreases and increases. This could reduce costs, because you'll never have to run excess Machines to handle peak load; you'll only run, and be charged for, the number of Machines that are needed at any given time.

The difference between this feature and what is typical in autoscaling, is that it doesn't create new Machines up to a specified maximum. It automatically starts only existing Machines. For example, if you want to have a maximum of 10 Machines available to service requests, then you need to create 10 Machines for your app.

If you need all of your app's Machines to be “always on”, then you can set `auto_stop_machines` and `auto_start_machines` to `false`. If `auto_stop_machines = true`, `min_machines_running = 0`, and there’s no traffic to your app, eventually all of your app's Machines could be stopped. 

If you only need one or a few instances of your app to keep running in your primary region all the time, then you can set `min_machines_running` to `1` or higher.

## Stop a Machine by terminating its main process

Setting your app to automatically stop when there's excess capacity using `auto_stop = true` is a substitute for when your app doesn't implement automatic shut down after a period of inactivity. If you want a custom shut-down process for your app, then you can code your app to exit from within when idle.

Here are some examples:

* [Shutting Down a Phoenix App When Idle](https://fly.io/phoenix-files/shut-down-idle-phoenix-app/): a post by Chris McCord on adding a task to an Elixir app's supervision tree that shuts down the Erlang runtime when there are no active connections.
* For Rails apps, dockerfile-rails provides a [--max-idle](https://github.com/rubys/dockerfile-rails#addremove-a-feature) option that will exit after _n_ seconds of inactivity.
* [A Tired Proxy in Go](https://github.com/superfly/tired-proxy) used in [Building an In-Browser IDE the Hard Way](https://fly.io/blog/remote-ide-machines/). [There's a community fork with more recent updates](https://community.fly.io/t/improved-tired-proxy-for-use-with-fly-machines/10584).
* A minimal demo app in Typescript/Remix: [code](https://github.com/fly-apps/autoscale-to-zero-demo) &amp; [demo](https://autoscale-to-zero-demo.fly.dev/).

As of `flyctl` v0.0.520, Fly Postgres [supports this too](https://community.fly.io/t/scale-to-zero-postgres-for-hobby-projects/12212)!
