Fly Launch is a collection of opinionated Fly.io platform features that help you configure and orchestrate your app as a unit. The following are some Fly Launch features:

- the `fly launch` command to get started
- the `fly.toml` file for app configuration
- the `fly deploy` command to deploy all your app's Machines
- the `fly scale` command for horizontal and vertical scaling

You can also configure and manage Fly Machines individually; see the [Fly Machines](/docs/machines/) docs.
