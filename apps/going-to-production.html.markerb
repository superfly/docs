This checklist guides you through setting up a production environment on Fly.io. What makes an app production-ready can vary from one framework to another. You'll need to decide what checklist items will work for you; not all of the items will apply to your app and there may be other considerations not listed here.

**Important:** This list is neither exhaustive nor mandatory, and does not guarantee production-readiness for your app. Apps might have unique requirements for production.

## Security

- **Set up single sign-on for organizations:** Enable SSO on your organization to take advantage of Google or GitHub authentication security. See [Single sign-on for organizations](/docs/security/sso/).

- **Isolate staging and production environments:** Use organizations to limit access to your production environment. See [Blueprint: Staging and production isolation](/docs/blueprints/staging-prod-isolation/).

- **Enforce least privilege access:** Use access tokens to allow only the minimum access required by team members to your organization, apps, and Machines. See [access tokens](https://fly.io/docs/security/tokens/).

- **Protect sensitive information:** Set secrets to store sensitive data and make them available as environment variables to your app. See [Secrets and Fly Apps](/docs/apps/secrets/).

- **Make sure private services are not exposed:** Check that your private apps with services don't have public IP addresses. Run `fly ips list` and use `fly ips release` to release unnecessary public IPs. See flyctl [`fly ips` commands](/docs/flyctl/ips/). Assign private apps a [Flycast address](https://fly.io/docs/networking/flycast/) instead.

- **Use Arcjet application security for JavaScript apps:** Secure your app with rate limiting, bot protection, email validation, and defense against common attacks through our extension partner Arcjet. Currently [free in beta](/docs/reference/arcjet/#pricing), but pricing is subject to change. See [Application Security by Arcjet](/docs/reference/arcjet/).

## Networking

- **Set up a custom domain:** Configure a certificate for your domain. See [Use a custom domain](/docs/networking/custom-domain/).

- **Consider a dedicated IPv4 address:** Completely eliminate the chance of blacklisted spammers causing problems for your app. There is a small [added cost](/docs/about/pricing/#anycast-ip-addresses) for dedicated IPv4 addresses. See [Dedicated IPv4](/docs/networking/services/#dedicated-ipv4).

- **Set up Flycast for private apps**: If you haven't already done so, give your private apps a Flycast address to communicate with them entirely on your private network. See [Flycast - Private Fly Proxy services](https://fly.io/docs/networking/flycast/).

## Databases

- **Run "production-grade" Postgres:** For Fly Postgres, our unmanaged database, set up replication clusters of 3+ servers. See [High Availability & Global Replication](/postgres/advanced-guides/high-availability-and-global-replication/). You can also use an external database provider and configure it for redundancy.

- **Set up offsite backups:** For all databases, it's essential to have a recovery plan that includes storing backups offsite.
  
## Monitoring

- **Export your logs:** Set up the Fly Log Shipper to aggregate your app’s logs to a service of your choice. See [Export logs](/docs/monitoring/exporting-logs/).

- **Use Sentry for Error tracking**: An application monitoring platform that helps you identify and fix software problems before they impact your users from our extension partner Sentry.Fly.io organizations get a year's worth of [Team Plan](https://sentry.io/pricing/+external) credits. See [Application Monitoring by Sentry](/docs/reference/sentry/).

## Availability, resiliency, and costs

- **Use multiple Machines for resiliency:** Make your app resilient to single-host failures with multiple Machines that stay stopped until you need them. See [Blueprint: Resilient apps use multiple Machines](/docs/blueprints/resilient-apps-multiple-machines/).

- **Add regions:** Scale your app in multiple regions closest to your app's users. See [Scale an app's regions](/docs/launch/scale-count/#scale-an-apps-regions).

- **Refine the default autostop/autostart settings**: Autostop/autostart lets you stop or suspend Machines when there's low traffic, saving on resource usage and costs. You get autostop/autostart by default with a new app, but you can configure it to optimize for your use case. See [Autostop/autostart Machines](/docs/launch/autostop-autostart/).

- **Set up autoscaling by metric:** For apps that aren't running web services, use the autoscaler app to scale your app's Machines based on any metric, saving on resource usage and costs. See [Autoscale based on metrics](/docs/launch/autoscale-by-metric/).

## App performance

- **Get Machine sizing right:** Most production apps require 2x or performance CPUs. Also make sure you have enough RAM for your app and/or enable [swapping to disk](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/#swap_size_mb-option) to deal with brief spikes in memory use. See [Machine sizing](docs/machines/guides-examples/machine-sizing/).

- **Fine-tune your app:** Learn about optimizing your app on Fly.io. See [Tips to fine-tune and your app on Fly.io](/docs/reference/fine-tune-apps/).

## CI/CD

- **Generate review apps with GitHub Actions:** Automatically generate ephemeral review apps on Fly.io for each pull request (PR) using GitHub Actions. See [Blueprint: Git Branch Preview Environments on GitHub](/docs/blueprints/review-apps-guide/).

- **Deploy with GitHub Actions:** Set up your app for continuous deployment to Fly.io from the app’s GitHub repository. See [Continuous Deployment with Fly.io and GitHub Actions](/docs/app-guides/continuous-deployment-with-github-actions/).

## Get support

- **Community:** Check out our [community](https://community.fly.io/) to get help and answers.

- **Consider a plan for email support:** You get email support with a [Launch, Scale, or Enterprise plan](https://fly.io/plans).
