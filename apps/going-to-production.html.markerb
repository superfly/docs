## Overview

Moving an app from staging to production can expose unexpected failure modes: security holes, performance and scaling issues, or data loss. This checklist is meant to catch common pitfalls for apps on Fly.io, but it’s not a guarantee of production readiness. Not every item here will apply to your app, and you may have additional requirements that aren't listed. Use this as a foundation and adapt it to your needs. Think of this list as a scaffold, not a silver bullet.

<div class="important icon">
**Important:** The checklist is not exhaustive and does not guarantee production-readiness for your app. Apps can have unique requirements for production depending on the framework and type of app. Some items won't be applicable and there may be other considerations not listed here; you'll need to decide which checklist items work for your app.

## Security
