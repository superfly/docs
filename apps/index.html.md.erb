Fly Launch is our a Platform-as-a-Service product that includes some good stuff to help you serve up your app:

- the `fly launch` command to get started
- the `fly.toml` file for app configuration
- the `fly deploy` command to deploy all your app's Machines
- process groups to run multiple processes
- horizontal and vertical scaling
- insert useful "and more!" statement here
