Volumes are local persistent storage for [Fly Machines](/docs/machines/). Volumes allow an app to save its state&mdash;to preserve configuration, session or user data&mdash;and then be restarted with that information in place. You can access and write to a volume on a Machine just like a regular directory.

<div class="warning">
<b>Always run at least two volumes per app.</b> We usually recommend running at least two Machines per app to increase availability, and if you're using volumes, then each Machine should have an attached volume. Also note that volumes don't sync up by themselves; your app needs to take care of that. Refer to [Fly Volumes](/docs/reference/volumes/) for details about how volumes work.
</div>

## Launch a new app with a Fly Volume

Launch a new app with one Machine and an attached volume, and then clone the Machine to scale out.

### Launch the app, but don't deploy it yet

The app has to exist for the volume to be created. The volume has to exist before you can mount it to a Machine. The shortest path to a Machine with a mounted volume begins by launching the app, and saying `N` to "deploy now?":

```cmd
fly launch 
```
```out
...
Wrote config file fly.toml
? Would you like to deploy now? No
...
Your app is ready! Deploy with `flyctl deploy`
```

### Configure the app to mount the new volume

Add a [`[mounts]` section](/docs/reference/configuration/#the-mounts-section) in the app's `fly.toml`. The `fly deploy` command you'll run in the next step will create the Machine and the volume during the deploy process. The following configuration exposes data from a volume named `myapp_data` under the `/data` directory in the Machine's file system.

```toml
[mounts]
  source="myapp_data"
  destination="/data"
```

### Deploy the app

```cmd
fly deploy 
```

On the first deployment, you'll get one Machine. You can confirm this with `fly status`.

```cmd
fly status
```

```out
App
  Name     = myapp
  Owner    = personal
  Hostname = myapp.fly.dev
  Image    = image:latest
  Platform = machines

Machines
PROCESS	ID            	VERSION	REGION	STATE  	CHECKS 	LAST UPDATED
app    	5683606c41098e	1      	lhr   	started	1 total	2023-04-26T20:40:48Z
```

### Confirm the volume is mounted

You can check on all the volumes in your app using `fly volumes list`. The `ATTACHED VM` column lets you know which Machine, if any, the volume is mounted on.

```cmd
fly volumes list
```
```out
ID                      STATE   NAME    SIZE    REGION  ZONE    ENCRYPTED       ATTACHED VM     CREATED AT    
vol_zmjnv8m81p5rywgx    created data    1GB     lhr     b6a7    true            5683606c41098e  3 minutes ago
```

You can also see the volume in the Machine's file system (there's only one Machine so far):
```cmd
fly ssh console -s -C df
```
```out
? Select VM: lhr: 5683606c41098e fdaa:0:3b99:a7b:7e:3155:9844:2 nameless-feather-6339
Connecting to fdaa:0:3b99:a7b:7e:3155:9844:2... complete

devtmpfs          103068      0    103068   0% /dev
/dev/vda         8191416 172748   7582856   3% /
shm               113224      0    113224   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs             113224      0    113224   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/vdb         1011672   2564    940500   1% /data
```

Voilà: our 1GB volume is mounted at `/data`. You can access and write to a volume on a Machine just like a regular directory.

### Clone the first Machine to scale out to two VMs

```cmd
fly machine clone 5683606c41098e
```

Check what that did:

```cmd
fly volumes list
```
```
ID                      STATE   NAME    SIZE    REGION  ZONE    ENCRYPTED       ATTACHED VM     CREATED AT     
vol_ez1nvxkwl3jrmxl7    created data    1GB     lhr     4de2    true            91851edb6ee983  39 seconds ago
vol_zmjnv8m81p5rywgx    created data    1GB     lhr     b6a7    true            5683606c41098e  7 minutes ago
```

`fly machine clone` creates an additional Machine with the same configuration as the source, and creates and mounts a volume for the new Machine, if the source Machine has one. **`fly machine clone` doesn't write data into the new volume.**

At this point there are two identically configured Machines on the app, each with a volume of the same size. You take it from here, setting up whatever data replication you need. 

### On a V1 (Nomad) app

Create an additional volume in a region, then [use `fly scale count`](/docs/apps/legacy-scaling/) to add a VM to use it.

## Add volumes to an existing app

You can add a volume, or volumes, to an existing app by adding `[mounts]` to the app's `fly.toml` file and creating the volumes using flyctl.

### Configure the app to mount the new volume

Add a [`[mounts]` section](/docs/reference/configuration/#the-mounts-section) in the app's `fly.toml`. The following example configures the app to expose data from a volume named `myapp_data` under the `/data` directory of the application.

```toml
[mounts]
  source="myapp_data"
  destination="/data"
```

### Create the volume

Create the volume (or volumes) in the same regions as your app's Machines. Run `fly status` to check the regions of the Machines.

```cmd
fly volumes create myapp_data -r lhr
```

<div class="callout">
You need to create as many volumes as you have Machines per process in your app. New apps deployed using the `fly launch` command might have two Machines in the `app` process by default.
</div>

If you configure [mounts] in `fly.toml` and then run `fly deploy` without first creating enough volumes, then you'll get an error similar to this one:

```out
Error: Process group 'app' needs volumes with name 'myapp_data' to fulfill mounts defined in fly.toml; 
Run fly volume create myapp_data -r REGION for the following regions and counts: lhr=1.`
```

The error indicates that the app needs one more volume in the `lhr` region.

### Deploy the app

```cmd
fly deploy 
```

Run `fly volumes list` to verify that your volumes now have `ATTACHED VM` populated.

```cmd
fly volumes list
```
```out
ID                      STATE   NAME    SIZE    REGION  ZONE    ENCRYPTED       ATTACHED VM     CREATED AT    
vol_zmjnv8m81p5rywgx    created data    1GB     lhr     b6a7    true            5683606c41098e  3 minutes ago
```

## Add a volume to a Machine clone

If you're not using the `fly.toml` with `fly deploy` workflow for some Machines, you can still add a volume by cloning a Machine with no volume and attaching a new volume to it. You can also clone a Machine with a volume already attached, which gives you a new Machine with a new, empty, volume attached.

### Create the volume

Create the volume in the same region as your app.

```cmd
fly volumes create myapp_data -r lhr
```

### Clone the Machine

Clone one of your app's Machines (with no volume) and attach the volume you just created:

```
fly machine clone <machine-id> --attach-volume <vol-id>:<destination-mount-path>
```

`destination-mount-path` is the directory where the volume should be mounted on the file system.

For example:

```cmd
fly machine clone 148eddeef09789 --attach-volume vol_8l524yj0ko347zmp:/data
```

### Destroy the Machine used to create the clone

```cmd
fly machine destroy 148eddeef09789
```

Run `fly volumes list` to verify that the volume you just created has the newly-cloned Machine's ID listed under `ATTACHED VM`.

```cmd
fly volumes list
```
```out
ID                      STATE   NAME    SIZE    REGION  ZONE    ENCRYPTED       ATTACHED VM     CREATED AT    
vol_8l524yj0ko347zmp    created data    1GB     lhr     b6a7    true            5683606c41098e  3 minutes ago
```

Repeat the process for each machine that you want to add a volume to.

## Remove a volume from an app

You can't currently unmount a volume from an existing Machine. If you need to remove volumes from your app, you can [scale it](/docs/apps/scale-count/) down to zero Machines, [destroy all the volumes](/docs/reference/volumes#destroy-a-volume), remove the `mounts` section from `fly.toml`, and redeploy. **Only destroy a volume whose data you no longer need access to.**

### On a V1 (Nomad) app

Remove the `mounts` section from `fly.toml` and redeploy. This will create a new Machine without a volume. [Destroy any unused volumes](/docs/reference/volumes#destroy-a-volume), **only if you no longer need their data**.
