With Fly Launch, you can create a brand new app on Fly.io by running this command from the root directory of your project:

```cmd
fly launch
``` 

If you're in a hurry to try your first launch, we also have a condensed [Hands-on](/docs/hands-on/) that launches super simple demo app. You might also be interested in our [language- and framework-specific launch guides](/docs/languages-and-frameworks/).

## Ingredients for a successful Fly Launch

Here are the components of a successful launch, ready for the first deployment:

* a way to get a Docker image that Fly.io can use to boot up a Machine with your app running
* Fly.io-specific [configuration](/docs/reference/configuration/) for the app, in the form of a `fly.toml` file
* optional platform resources such as [public IP addresses](/docs/reference/services/), [Fly Volumes](/docs/reference/volumes), [app secrets](/docs/reference/secrets/), [Fly Postgres](/docs/postgres/) clusters, integrated resources like [Redis by Upstash](/docs/reference/redis/)

## Framework launch scanners

Depending on your project, `fly launch` might be able to look at your app's source code and get through that ingredient list, straight to a deployed Fly App. This is most likely for frameworks on which Fly.io has people specializing full time. Right now that's [Elixir/Phoenix](/docs/elixir/), [Laravel](/docs/laravel/), [Rails](/docs/rails/), and [Django](/docs/django/), but we also have launch guides for other [languages and frameworks](/docs/languages-and-frameworks/).

Our best scanners furnish a Dockerfile from which your app's image will be built. Some of our terrible older scanners may invoke [buildpacks](/docs/reference/builders/#buildpacks), which tend to be slow and brittle.

Running `fly launch` in a directory containing a working Django app (it happens to be the one from [our Django getting-started example](https://fly.io/docs/django/getting-started/)):

```cmd
fly launch
```
```out
Creating app in /Users/chris/FlyTests/django
Scanning source code
Detected a Django app
? Choose an app name (leave blank to generate one): 
...
```

The flyctl Django scanner has taken ownership of my launch. Visit our [Django guide](/docs/django/getting-started/) to see how that story will end. (Spoiler: it has a happy ending.)

## Custom launch

You can nudge `fly launch` to better suit your project. 

### Choose how the Docker image is built

Tell `fly launch` how you want to get the Docker image for your app, using either the `--image` or `--dockerfile` option, or by catching the Dockerfile launch scanner's attention with the presence of a [Dockerfile](/docs/languages-and-frameworks/dockerfile/) in your app's root directory. The Dockerfile scanner doesn't do a lot of configuration, but it prevents other scanners from taking over.

The actual Docker image build (or image pull) for a Fly App takes place during deployment. `fly launch` sets the stage by recording how to build, or get, the image, and both the first and all later deploys use that information.

### Customize the configuration file

You can provide your own `fly.toml` and `fly launch` will offer to read it in, in lieu of the default config. `fly.toml` sets a starting point for the app configuration, and in some cases a framework launch scanner might overwrite parts of it.

There are also [a number of other options](/docs/flyctl/launch/) you can use to exert control over `fly launch`.

If `fly launch` doesn't have a scanner that can set up your app automatically, it will still initialize a new Fly App in your Fly.io organization and provide you with a default app configuration that's a reasonable starting point for a simple web app. 

It's also possible to perform an entirely manual "launch", skipping all the launch scanners and full-service resource provisioning, using `fly apps create`, a hand-crafted (or copied) `fly.toml`, and step-by-step resource provisioning, followed by `fly deploy`.

## After `fly launch`

If you've run `fly launch` but haven't deployed yet, you can change your configuration, update your app source, or change or provision platform resources such as [public IP addresses](/docs/reference/services/), [Fly Volumes](/docs/reference/volumes), [app secrets](/docs/reference/secrets/), [Fly Postgres](/docs/postgres/) clusters, or integrated resources like [Redis by Upstash](/docs/reference/redis/), and then [(re)deploy with `fly deploy`](/docs/apps/deploy/).

Once your app is deployed you'll probably want to check up on it using one or more of the techniques in [Get Information About an App](/docs/apps/info/). When you're ready to [go to production](/docs/going-to-production/), [scale up](/docs/apps/scale-count/) to two or more Machines [for high availability](/docs/apps/).

If you want to go deeper, you can do even more, at a lower level, with [Machines](/docs/machines/).
