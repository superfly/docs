## Scale up

Use `fly machine clone` to add a Machine that will be managed by `fly deploy`. The new Machine will be, as you would expect, a copy of the specified Machine. If the original Machine has a [Fly Volume](/docs/reference/volumes/) attached, an empty volume will be provisioned for the new Machine. It's up to you to decide what to put on the new volume; `fly machine clone` will not automatically copy the contents of the original Machine's volume.

```
fly machine clone 21781973f03e89
fly machine clone --region syd 21781973f03e89
fly machine clone --region ams 21781973f03e89
```

After running the above commands, there are four Machines running for this app: the original Machine plus three new ones. 

## Scale down

Use `fly machine stop` and `fly machine destroy` to scale down the app:

```
$ fly machine stop 9080524f610e87
$ fly machine destroy 9080524f610e87
```

If a Machine is misbehaving (for instance, it's not `stop`ping successfully), you can try `fly machine destroy --force` to get rid of it.

```cmd
fly machine destroy --force 0e286039f42e86
```

If you `destroy` a Machine, don't forget that any volume that it had been using still exists until you either `fly volumes delete` it or `fly destroy` the Fly App it belongs to.

**For existing Nomad/V1 Fly Apps**: Existing apps whose VMs are managed by Nomad can still be scaled "horizontally" using [`fly scale count`](/docs/flyctl/scale-count/). For more, see [Scale V1 (Nomad) Apps](/docs/apps/legacy-scaling/).
