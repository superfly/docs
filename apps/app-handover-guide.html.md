**If you're building an app for someone else and they’re going to run it themselves on Fly.io, you’ve got two good options. You can either start development inside their Fly.io organization, or build it in yours and move it over later. Here’s how both paths work, and what can get messy during the move.**

### Option 1: Build in the customer’s Fly org from day one

The cleanest handoff is no handoff at all. Have the customer create their own Fly.io organization before you start building.

1. **They create the organization and add a payment method.** Basic stuff. This is what Fly.io bills against.
1. **They invite your devs to their org.** They can do this in the dashboard under “Team → Invite Member.” You now have access to deploy apps directly into their account.
1. **You build inside their org.** Fly.io treats organizations as isolated namespaces, so there’s no awkward boundary crossing here. It’s just your team shipping code, in their environment.
1. **They remove you when it’s over.** Or not—you can stick around for maintenance if that’s part of the deal.
1. **What can get messy.** Make sure that the invited developer is not the only admin user in your customer's org. Double-check that your customer has at least two admins in their org.

### Option 2: Build in your org, then move the app to theirs

Sometimes it’s easier to get going inside your own org—especially if you’ve got infra and tooling already set up. When the app is ready, you move it.

Here’s how that works:

1. **Build as usual in your organization.**
1. **Have the customer invite one of your devs to their org.** This person needs to be in _both_ orgs to do the move.
1. **Transfer the app** 
1. Use `fly apps move <app-name> --org <target-org-name>` 
1. Heads up: the move causes a couple minutes of downtime. It’s a good idea to schedule this when traffic is low, and inform your users of a maintenance window. 
1. What moves automatically: 
    - Machines and volumes (data included) 
    - Secrets and environment variables 
    - Certificates and domain names 
    - LiteFS databases (as long as you’re using `$FLY_APP_NAME` for the Consul key) 
1. What doesn’t move automatically: 
    - **Postgres** **(unmanaged and managed):** Moving Postgres databases across orgs is not supported. You’ll need to spin up a new Fly Postgres app in the target org and restore from a volume snapshot. Or you can use `pgloader` to migrate the data. 
    - **Upstash Redis:** This is tied to an org’s private network. You’ll need to provision a new DB in the new org. 
    - **Tigris buckets:** You’ll have to delete the old Tigris bucket, recreate it in the new org, and copy the data over (try `s3sync`). Don’t forget to reset your app’s secrets. 
    - **Sentry and other extensions**: Be sure to create fresh ones in the new org and reconfigure the app to use them.

### Summary

If you know up front that your customer will own the app long-term, starting in their org avoids a bunch of fiddly work later. But if you need to hand over an app from your org to theirs, Fly.io gives you enough tools to pull it off—just be ready to rewire a few things by hand.
