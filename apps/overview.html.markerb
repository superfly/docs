A Fly App is an abstraction for a group of Fly Machines running your code on Fly.io. You can create and manage your app as a whole using [Fly Launch](/docs/launch/), but you can also have a Fly App with individual Machines running tasks or user code.

From an admin point of view a Fly App is just a group of Machines (with optional attached volumes) that belongs to one organization.

From a developer point of view, a Fly App might be:

* a fullstack application (or just part of one)
* a database
* a few Machines running tasks, or a bunch of Machines, all with different configs, doing things you want them to do
* anything you can think of doing with fast-launching Machines, including [GPU Machines](/docs/gpus/) for AI/ML workloads

All the apps in your organization can communicate over a [private network](/docs/networking/private-networking/), so itâ€™s also possible to have multiple apps working together as one system.

Fly Apps include:

* app configuration
* provisioned resources
* Anycast IP addresses
* certificates
* custom domains
* secrets
* Fly Volumes (optional)

Fly Apps run on flyd. Learn more about how flyd works and how it came to be in the blog post: [Carving the Scheduler Out of Our Orchestrator](https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/).
