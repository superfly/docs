If you already have a Fly account, all you need to do is sign in with Flyctl. Simply run:

```cmd
flyctl auth login
```

Your browser will open up with the Fly sign-in screen, enter your user name and password to sign in. If you signed up with Github, use the `Sign in with Github` button to sign in.

Whichever route you take you will be returned to your command line, ready to use Fly.
