Fly Launch helps you quickly deploy almost any kind of app using a Docker image. To learn more about the different ways to get your app ready to deploy, refer to [Fly Launch](/docs/apps/launch/).

For this example, you'll use our pre-built Docker image, `flyio/hellofly:latest`, to create and deploy a demo app.

Every Fly Launch app uses a `fly.toml` config file to tell the system how to deploy it. Running `fly launch` to create a new app generates the `fly.toml` file, which will provide some useful defaults that you can tweak through a web interface before deploying the app.

To create the demo app, run:

```cmd
fly launch --image flyio/hellofly:latest
```

You'll get a summary of the defaults chosen for your app. For example:

```output 
Using image flyio/hellofly:latest
Creating app in /Users/username/my-app-name
We're about to launch your app on Fly.io. Here's what you're getting:

Organization: MyName                 (fly launch defaults to the personal org)
Name:         my-app-name            (derived from your directory name)
Region:       Secaucus, NJ (US)      (this is the fastest region for you)
App Machines: shared-cpu-1x, 1GB RAM (most apps need about 1GB of RAM)
Postgres:     <none>                 (not requested)
Redis:        <none>                 (not requested)

? Do you want to tweak these settings before proceeding? (y/N)
```

Type `y` at the prompt to open the Fly Launch page, where you can make changes to your app config.

For this example, you'll probably want to change the app name and maybe the [region](/docs/reference/regions/) to deploy in. App names need to be globally unique and can include only numbers, lowercase letters, and dashes.

Click **Confirm Settings** to confirm and deploy the demo app.

Then return to your terminal to view the progress of the app deployment. For example:

```output
Waiting for launch data... Done
Created app 'my-app-name' in organization 'personal'
Admin URL: https://fly.io/apps/my-app-name
Hostname: my-app-name.fly.dev
Wrote config file fly.toml

This deployment will:
 * create 2 "app" machines

No machines in group app, launching a new machine
Creating a second machine to increase service availability
Finished launching new machines
-------
NOTE: The machines for [app] have services with 'auto_stop_machines = true' that will be stopped when idling

When you run a command, flyctl will look for a `fly.toml` file to find the name of the app to operate on, and for an app configuration to apply during deployment. For all the config options in `fly.toml`, see the [Fly Launch configuration (fly.toml)](/docs/reference/configuration/) reference.
