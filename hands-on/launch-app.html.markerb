Fly Launch helps you quickly deploy almost any kind of app using a Docker image. To learn more about the different ways to get your app ready to deploy, refer to [Fly Launch](/docs/apps/launch/).

For this example, you can use our pre-built Docker image, `flyio/hellofly:latest`, to create and deploy an app. 

Each Fly Launch application uses a `fly.toml` file to tell the system how to deploy it. The `fly.toml` file can be automatically generated with the `fly launch` command, which will provide some useful defaults that you can tweak through a web interface before deploying the app.

Run:

```cmd
fly launch --image flyio/hellofly:latest
```

You'll get a summary of the defaults chosen for your app:

```output 
Using image flyio/hellofly:latest
Creating app in /Users/username/my-app-name
We're about to launch your app on Fly.io. Here's what you're getting:

Organization: MyName                 (fly launch defaults to the personal org)
Name:         my-app-name            (derived from your directory name)
Region:       Secaucus, NJ (US)      (this is the fastest region for you)
App Machines: shared-cpu-1x, 1GB RAM (most apps need about 1GB of RAM)
Postgres:     <none>                 (not requested)
Redis:        <none>                 (not requested)

? Do you want to tweak these settings before proceeding? (y/N)
```

Type `y` at the prompt to open the Fly Launch page, where you can make changes to your app config.

For this example, the only settings you might want to change are the app name and the [region](/docs/reference/regions/) to deploy in. App names can include only numbers, lowercase letters, and dashes.

Click **Confirm Settings** to confirm and deploy the example app.

You can return to your terminal to view the progress of the app deployment:

When you run a command, flyctl always checks to see if `fly.toml` exists in the current directory, and then checks the `app` value at the start of the file. Many commands use this app name to determine which Fly App to apply to by default. The `fly.toml` file also defines how the app will be built (from a pre-built Docker image, in this case), the ports for services, and further configuration to be applied to the app when it deploys.
