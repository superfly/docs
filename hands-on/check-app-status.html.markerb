Now that the application has been deployed, let's find out more about its deployment. The command `fly status` will give you the basic details.

```cmd
fly status
```
```out
App
  Name     = hellofly          
  Owner    = personal       
  Hostname = hellofly.fly.dev
  Image    = flyio/hellofly:latest
  Platform = machines       

Machines
PROCESS	ID            	VERSION	REGION	STATE  	CHECKS	LAST UPDATED
app    	148e453b7d7289	1      	ord   	started	      	2023-05-17T17:39:37Z
app    	5683d311c3228e	1      	ord   	stopped	      	2023-05-17T17:38:44Z
```

In this example, the application has been deployed with a DNS hostname of `hellofly.fly.dev`. Your deployment's name will, of course, be different. We can also see that the app has 2 Machines running in the ord (Chicago) region. We recommend running at least 2 machines to improve availability in case of hardware or host failure.
