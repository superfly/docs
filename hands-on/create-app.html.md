Fly allows you to deploy any kind of app as long as it is packaged in a **Docker image**. That also means you can just deploy a docker image and as it happens we have one ready to go in `flyio/hellofly:latest`. 

Each Fly application needs a `fly.toml` file to tell the system how we'd like to deploy it. That file can be automatically generated with the `flyctl launch` command. 

```cmd
flyctl launch --image flyio/hellofly:latest
```
```output 
? Select organization: Personal (personal)
```
**Organizations**: Organizations are a way of sharing applications and resources between Fly users. Every fly account has a personal organization, called `personal`, which is only visible to your account. Let's select that for this guide.

```output
? Select region: ord (Chicago, Illinois (US))
```
Next, you'll be prompted to select a region to deploy in. The closest region to you is selected by default. You can use this or change to another region.

You will also be prompted for credit card payment information, required for charges outside the free tier on Fly. See [Pricing](/docs/about/pricing) for more details on what is included in the free tier. If you do not enter a details here, you will be unable to create a new application on Fly until you add a credit card to your account.

At this point, `flyctl` creates an app for you and writes your configuration to a `fly.toml` file. The `fly.toml` file now contains a default configuration for deploying your app.

```toml

app = "hellofly"

[build]
  image = "flyio/hellofly:latest"

[[services]]
  internal_port = 8080

...
```

The `flyctl` command will always refer to this file in the current directory if it exists, specifically for the `app` name value at the start. That name will be used to identify the application on the Fly platform. You can also see how the app will be built and that internal port setting. The rest of the file contains settings to be applied to the application when it deploys. 

We'll have more details about these properties as we progress, but for now, it's enough to say that they mostly configure which ports the application will be visible on.
