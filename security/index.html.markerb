Securing a public cloud platform like Fly.io is a hard problem, and we take it seriously. The Fly.io platform comes with built-in security like hardware isolation, [private networking](/docs/networking/private-networking/) over WireGuard, and [TLS termination](/docs/networking/services/#tls-handler).

## Fly.io platform security

- **[Single sign-on (SSO) for organizations](/docs/security/sso/):** Set up org-wide SSO with Google or GitHub.
- **[Built-in TLS termination](/docs/security/tls-termination/):** You get TLS termination by default for your web apps.
- **[Fly.io security practices and compliance](/docs/security/security-at-fly-io/):** Learn about our security practices for the Fly.io platform.

## Security extensions

Security add-ons from our extension partners.

- **[Application Security by Arcjet](/docs/reference/arcjet/):** Use the Arcjet security layer to protect your JavaScript app with just a few lines of code.
