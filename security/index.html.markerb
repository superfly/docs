Securing a public cloud platform like Fly.io is a hard problem, and we take it seriously. The Fly.io platform comes with built-in security like hardware isolation, [private networking](/docs/networking/private-networking/) over WireGuard, and [TLS termination](/docs/networking/services/#tls-handler).
