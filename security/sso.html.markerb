Organizations are administrative entities on Fly.io that let you to manage billing separately, control access by adding and removing members, and share app development environments. You can, and usually should, require members of your organizations to use SSO. Fly.io supports Google and GitHub as Identity Providers, and you can use one or both. If you already use Google or GitHub, enabling SSO takes advantage of their built-in security, like 2FA/MFA and passkeys.

## Authenticating user accounts vs. organizations

An individual Fly.io user account can belong to multiple organizations, each with different access requirements. Users continue log in to Fly.io with their usual username/password or SSO. When you set up SSO as a requirement for an organization, users will need to re-authenticate to access org-specific resources and information.

## Set up SSO using Google workspace access

From the Fly.io [dashboard](https://fly.io/dashboard/), select an organization from the dropdown. Go to **Settings > Single Sign On > Google SSO Requirement**. Enter the Google Hosted Domain for SSO, check **Enable**, and click Save.

## Set up SSO using GitHub organization access

Install the [Fly.io GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/fly-io/installations/select_target+external) on the GitHub organization you want to use for SSO.

From the Fly.io [dashboard](https://fly.io/dashboard/), select an organization from the dropdown. Go to **Settings > Single Sign On > GitHub SSO Requirement**. Enter the GitHub organization ID for SSO, check **Enable**, and click Save.
