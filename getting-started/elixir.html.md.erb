<%= partial "partials/intro", locals: { runtime: "Elixir Phoenix", database: true } %>

We'll be using the standard web application generated by the Elixir [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/). This guide assumes you're working with **Phoenix 1.6.3** or later which include a code generator to simplify deployment.

## Generate the app and deploy with Postgres

If you just want to see how Fly deployment works, follow these steps.

First, [install flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/), your Fly app command center, and [sign up to Fly](http://localhost:4567/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/#first-time-or-no-fly-account-sign-up-for-fly) if you haven't already.

Now let's generate a shiny, new Phoenix app.

```cmd
mix phx.new hello_elixir
```
```output
* creating fresh/config/config.exs
* creating fresh/config/dev.exs
* creating fresh/config/prod.exs
...
```
<%= partial "partials/launch_with_postgres", locals: { detected: "Phoenix", app_name: "hello_elixir" } %>

## _Running the Application Locally_

Let's walk through working with Phoenix locally and preparing it for deployment. We can start with a brand new Phoenix application.

```bash
mix phx.new hello_elixir
```

**Tip:** Make sure you have a local [PostgreSQL server installed](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides) and running.

Now, we setup the database and start the application.

```cmd
mix ecto.setup
```

```output
The database for HelloElixir.Repo has been created
```

```cmd
mix phx.server
```

```output
[info] Running HelloElixirWeb.Endpoint with cowboy 2.8.0 at 0.0.0.0:4000 (http)
[info] Access HelloElixirWeb.Endpoint at http://localhost:4000
```

Connect to localhost:4000 to confirm that you have a working Elixir application.

## For Phoenix versions earlier than 1.6.3

We highly recommend upgrading to Phoenix 1.6.3 or higher. If you can't, follow these instructions to setup your app for deployment.

### _Generate Release Config Files_

We use the `mix release.init` command to create some sample files in the `./rel` directory.

```cmd
mix release.init
```
```output
* creating rel/vm.args.eex
* creating rel/remote.vm.args.eex
* creating rel/env.sh.eex
* creating rel/env.bat.eex
```

## _Special Note on Fly Networking_

Internally Fly uses IPv6 networking. This enables some cool features, but legacy Elixir applications need to be configured to work smoothly with it.
These config changes tell Elixir, Phoenix, and the BEAM that we are using IPv6 addresses. The options look like `inet6` and `inet6_tcp`.
The next steps are how we configure that in our application.

We only need to configure `rel/env.sh.eex`. This file gets turned into a shell script that the release uses to set ENV values used when we run
any release commands. Here's the important parts.

```
#!/bin/sh

ip=$(grep fly-local-6pn /etc/hosts | cut -f 1)
export RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION=name
export ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS="-proto_dist inet6_tcp"
```

We configure the node to use a full node name when it runs. We get the Fly assigned IPv6 address and use that to name our node. Finally, we configure `inet6_tcp` for the BEAM as well.

Even if you don't care to cluster your nodes together, you still want to do this because it enables running an IEx shell in a running node.

### _Special Note on Clustering_

To make clustering your Elixir applications easier on Fly, in the `env.sh.eex` file, the `RELEASE_NODE` is named using the `$FLY_APP_NAME` and
the IPv6 address. It will look something like this in practice.

```
fly-elixir@fdaa:0:1da8:a7b:ac2:216b:da3f:2
```

### _Runtime Config_

When we created the app, the file `config/runtime.exs` was created for us. Now we need to update it.

1. In the Repo config, the line `socket_options: [:inet6],` is commented out. Uncomment that line. This is important for our app to connect to the database over Fly's IPv6 network.
2. Since we _are_ using releases, uncomment the line for `config :hello_elixir, HelloElixirWeb.Endpoint, server: true`.
3. Add the `app_name` setup that uses `FLY_APP_NAME` and add it to our endpoint in the `url` entry.

The simplified file looks this. I added the "IMPORTANT" comments to draw attention to the lines we're talking about.

```elixir
import Config

if config_env() == :prod do
  database_url =
    System.get_env("DATABASE_URL") ||
      raise """
      environment variable DATABASE_URL is missing.
      For example: ecto://USER:PASS@HOST/DATABASE
      """

  config :hello_elixir, HelloElixir.Repo,
    # IMPORTANT: Or it won't find the DB server
    socket_options: [:inet6],
    url: database_url,
    pool_size: String.to_integer(System.get_env("POOL_SIZE") || "10")

  secret_key_base =
    System.get_env("SECRET_KEY_BASE") ||
      raise """
      environment variable SECRET_KEY_BASE is missing.
      You can generate one by calling: mix phx.gen.secret
      """

  # IMPORTANT: Get the app_name we're using
  app_name =
    System.get_env("FLY_APP_NAME") ||
      raise "FLY_APP_NAME not available"

  config :hello_elixir, HelloElixirWeb.Endpoint,
    # IMPORTANT: tell our app about the host name to use when generating URLs
    url: [host: "#{app_name}.fly.dev", port: 80],
    http: [
      ip: {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
      port: String.to_integer(System.get_env("PORT") || "4000")
    ],
    secret_key_base: secret_key_base

  # IMPORTANT: Enable the endpoint for releases
  config :hello_elixir, HelloElixirWeb.Endpoint, server: true
end
```

This code expects to receive some ENV values at runtime. We're expecting `SECRET_KEY_BASE` with our Phoenix secret, our `FLY_APP_NAME` from Fly, and the `DATABASE_URL` for connecting to a Fly hosted Postgres database.

Also, you don't need to turn on TLS for connecting to the Postgres instance. Fly private networks operate over an encrypted WireGuard mesh, so traffic between application servers and PostgreSQL is already encrypted and there's no need to TLS.

## _Docker Setup_

### _Dockerfile_

You can find a good Dockerfile ready to build your application in the [hello_elixir GitHub repo](https://github.com/fly-apps/hello_elixir/blob/main/Dockerfile). It is important to note that it uses a Debian-slim base image to build. This avoids DNS issues in Alpine images. The [base elixir image is maintained by the hexpm](https://hub.docker.com/r/hexpm/elixir/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) org and is kept up to date. [Hex.pm](https://hex.pm/) is the official package repository for Elixir. There are other options instead of Debian there as well if you prefer.

The Dockerfile uses a two-stage approach. There are two `FROM` commands. The first stage pulls in the source and builds the release. The second stage takes the prepared release and sets it up in a minimal Docker image. The final deployed image contains only our release.

### _Docker Ignore File_

We add the file `.dockerignore` to the project with the following contents. Depending on how you `COPY` things into the Dockerfile, you may or may not need to configure this.

```
assets/node_modules/
deps/
```

This ensures we keep any natively compiled Elixir or Node packages from our development environments from causing a problem in the Linux container.

## _Launch the App on Fly_

To launch an app on fly, run `fly launch` in the directory with your source code. This creates and configures a fly app for you by inspecting your source code, then prompts you to deploy.

```cmd
fly launch
```
```output
$ fly launch
Scanning source code
Detected Dockerfile app
? Select region: sea (Seattle, Washington (US))
Created app fly-elixir in organization personal
Wrote config file fly.toml
? Would you like to deploy now? No
```

Don't deploy it just yet. We're going to adjust the generated `fly.toml` file first.

The `fly launch` command scans your source code to determine how to build a deployment image as well as identify any other configuration your app needs, such as secrets and exposed ports.

After your source code is scanned and the results are printed, you'll be prompted for an organization. Organizations are a way of sharing applications and resources between Fly users. Every Fly account has a personal organization, called `personal`, which is only visible to your account. Let's select that for this guide.

Next, you'll be prompted to select a region to deploy in. The closest region to you is selected by default. You can use this or change to another region. You can find the [list of supported regions here](/docs/reference/regions/).

At this point, `flyctl` created an app for you and wrote your configuration to a `fly.toml` file. You'll then be prompted to build and deploy your app. Once complete, your app will be running on fly.

## _Inside `fly.toml`_

The `fly.toml` file now contains a default configuration for deploying your app. In the process of creating that file, `flyctl` has also generated a Fly-side application slot with a new name. In this case, it is `fly-elixir`. If we look at the `fly.toml` file we can see the name in there:

```toml
app = "fly-elixir"

kill_signal = "SIGINT"
kill_timeout = 5
processes = []

[env]

[experimental]
  allowed_public_ports = []
  auto_rollback = true

[[services]]
  http_checks = []
  internal_port = 8080
  processes = ["app"]
  protocol = "tcp"
  script_checks = []

  [services.concurrency]
    hard_limit = 25
    soft_limit = 20
    type = "connections"

  [[services.ports]]
    handlers = ["http"]
    port = 80

  [[services.ports]]
    handlers = ["tls", "http"]
    port = 443

  [[services.tcp_checks]]
    grace_period = "1s"
    interval = "15s"
    restart_limit = 0
    timeout = "2s"
```

The `flyctl` command will always refer to this file in the current directory if it exists, specifically for the `app` name/value at the start. That name is used to identify the application to the Fly platform. The rest of the file contains settings to be applied to the application when it deploys.

We'll have more details about these properties as we progress, but for now, it's enough to say that they mostly configure which ports the application will be visible on.

## _Customizing `fly.toml`_

Elixir applications need a little customization to the generated `fly.toml` file.

```toml
app = "fly-elixir"

kill_signal = "SIGTERM"
kill_timeout = 5
processes = []

[deploy]
  release_command = "/app/entry eval HelloElixir.Release.migrate"

[env]

[experimental]
  allowed_public_ports = []
  auto_rollback = true

[[services]]
  http_checks = []
  internal_port = 4000
  processes = ["app"]
  protocol = "tcp"
  script_checks = []

  [services.concurrency]
    hard_limit = 25
    soft_limit = 20
    type = "connections"

  [[services.ports]]
    handlers = ["http"]
    port = 80

  [[services.ports]]
    handlers = ["tls", "http"]
    port = 443

  [[services.tcp_checks]]
    grace_period = "30s"  # allow some time for startup
    interval = "15s"
    restart_limit = 0
    timeout = "2s"
```

There are two important changes here:

- We added the `[deploy]` setting. This tells Fly that on a new deploy, **run our database migrations**. The Dockerfile we're using creates a symlink to your app name called `entry`. This uses that symlink run the migrate command.
- The `kill_signal` is set to `SIGTERM`. An Elixir node does a clean shutdown when it receives a `SIGTERM` from the OS.
- The `internal_port` is set to 4000 for our Elixir application. The port value should match your application.

Some other values were tweaked as well.

## _Preparing to Deploy_

We're almost there! Before we can deploy our new app, we need to setup a few things in our Fly account first. Namely, we want to provide the needed secrets and we need a database!

### _Setting our Secrets on Fly_

Elixir has a mix task that can generate a new Phoenix key base secret. Let's use that.

```bash
mix phx.gen.secret
```

It generates a long string of random text. Let's store that as a secret for our app. When we run this command in our project folder, `flyctl` uses the `fly.toml` file to know which app we are setting the value on.

```
fly secrets set SECRET_KEY_BASE=<GENERATED>
```

### _Creating our Fly Postgres Database_

```cmd
fly postgres create
```
```output
? App name: hello-elixir-db
Automatically selected personal organization: Mark Ericksen
? Select region: sea (Seattle, Washington (US))
? Select VM size: shared-cpu-1x - 256
? Volume size (GB): 10
Creating postgres cluster hello-elixir-db in organization personal
Postgres cluster hello-elixir-db created
  Username:    <USER>
  Password:    <PASSWORD>
  Hostname:    hello-elixir-db.internal
  Proxy Port:  5432
  PG Port: 5433
Save your credentials in a secure place, you won't be able to see them again!

Monitoring Deployment

2 desired, 2 placed, 2 healthy, 0 unhealthy [health checks: 6 total, 6 passing]
--> v0 deployed successfully

Connect to postgres
Any app within the personal organization can connect to postgres using the above credentials and the hostname "hello-elixir-db.internal."
For example: postgres://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@hello-elixir-db.internal:5432

See the postgres docs for more information on next steps, managing postgres, connecting from outside fly:  https://fly.io/docs/reference/postgres/
```

We can take the defaults which select the lowest values for CPU, size, etc. This is perfect for getting started.

### _Attach our App to the Database_

We use `flyctl` to attach our app to the database which also sets our needed `DATABASE_URL` ENV value.

```cmd
fly postgres attach --postgres-app hello-elixir-db
```
```output
Postgres cluster hello-elixir-db is now attached to fly-elixir
The following secret was added to fly-elixir:
  DATABASE_URL=postgres://<NEW_USER>:<NEW_PASSWORD>@hello-elixir-db.internal:5432/fly_elixir?sslmode=disable
```

We can see the secrets that Fly is using for our app like this.

```cmd
fly secrets list
```
```output
NAME            DIGEST                           DATE
DATABASE_URL    830d8769ff33cba6c8b29d1cd6a6fbac 1m10s ago
SECRET_KEY_BASE 84c992ac7ef334c21f2aaecd41c43666 9m20s ago
```

Looks like we're ready to deploy!

## _Deploying to Fly_

To deploy your app, just run just run:

```cmd
fly deploy
```

First, `flyctl` builds our Dockerfile and pushes it to a Fly container registry.

This will lookup our `fly.toml` file, and get the app name `fly-elixir` from there. Then `flyctl` will start the process of deploying our application to the Fly platform. Flyctl returns you to the command line when it's done.

## _Viewing the Deployed App_

Now that the application has been deployed, let's find out more about its deployment. The command `fly status` will give you all the essential details.

```cmd
fly status
```
```output
App
  Name     = fly-elixir
  Owner    = personal
  Version  = 3
  Status   = running
  Hostname = fly-elixir.fly.dev

Deployment Status
  ID          = 9762642f-baa4-e4df-c683-13f2ce26a6bc
  Version     = v3
  Status      = successful
  Description = Deployment completed successfully
  Instances   = 1 desired, 1 placed, 1 healthy, 0 unhealthy

Instances
ID       VERSION REGION DESIRED STATUS  HEALTH CHECKS      RESTARTS CREATED
f617e72a 3       sea    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        1m34s ago
```

## _Connecting to the App_

The quickest way to browse your newly deployed application is with the `fly open` command.

```cmd
fly open
```
```output
Opening https://fly-elixir.fly.dev/
```

Your browser will be sent to the displayed URL. Fly will auto-upgrade this URL to a HTTPS secured URL.

## _Arrived at Destination_

You have successfully built, deployed, and connected to your first Elixir application on Fly. Check out the following bonus sections to go further!

## _Bonus Sections_

With your application up and running, there are some additional things you can do to go further. Using some `flyctl` commands, we can easily do some powerful things with our application.

These bonus tips cover:

- Getting an IEx shell into your running node. This helps you manage and work with your running system.
- Clustering multiple Elixir nodes together. Say "Hello!" to the power of Distributed Computing!
- Scaling your application out to more machines and even distant regions (with or without clustering).

### _What is the IP Address?_

If you want to know what IP addresses the app is using, try `fly ips list`:

```cmd
fly ips list
```
```output
TYPE ADDRESS                              CREATED AT
v4   213.188.199.124                      24m5s ago
v6   2a09:8280:1:ce56:c80f:5071:6e94:6688 24m5s ago
```

### _Getting an IEx Shell into a Running Node_

As mentioned before, Elixir supports getting a IEx shell into a running production node. How cool is that? We already took the steps to configure `rel/env.sh.eex`, so this step should be pretty easy.

There are a couple prerequisites, we first need to establish an [SSH Shell](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/ssh/) to our machine on Fly.

This step sets up a root certificate for your account and then issues a certificate.

```
fly ssh establish
fly ssh issue
```

With SSH configured, let's open a console.

```cmd
fly ssh console
```
```output
Connecting to fly-elixir.internal... complete
/ #
```

If all has gone smoothly, then you have a shell into the machine! Now we just need to launch our remote IEx shell. The Dockerfile was configured to pull our application into `/app`. The Dockerfile also created a symlink to our app called `entry`, so our command looks like this:

```cmd
app/entry remote
```
```output
Erlang/OTP 23 [erts-11.2.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:1:1] [ds:1:1:10] [async-threads:1]

Interactive Elixir (1.11.2) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(hello_elixir@fdaa:0:1da8:a7b:ac4:b204:7e29:2)1>
```

Awesome! A running IEx shell into our node. You can safely disconnect it using CTRL+C, CTRL+C.

### _Clustering Your Application_

Elixir and the BEAM have the incredible ability to be clustered together and pass messages seamlessly between nodes. Fly makes clustering easy! This extra (and totally optional) portion of the guide walks you through clustering your Elixir application.

There are 2 parts to getting clustering quickly setup on Fly.

- Installing and using `libcluster`
- Scaling our application to multiple instances

#### _Adding `libcluster`_

The widely adopted library [libcluster](https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster) helps here.

Libcluster supports multiple strategies for finding and connecting with other nodes. The strategy we'll use is `DNSPoll` which was added in version 3.2.2 of `libcluster`, so make sure you're using that version or newer.


After installing `libcluster`, add it to the application like this:

```elixir
defmodule HelloElixir.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    topologies = Application.get_env(:libcluster, :topologies) || []

    children = [
      # ...
      # setup for clustering
      {Cluster.Supervisor, [topologies, [name: HelloElixir.ClusterSupervisor]]}
    ]

    # ...
  end

  # ...
end
```

Our next step is to add the `topologies` configuration to the file `config/runtime.exs`.

```elixir
  app_name =
    System.get_env("FLY_APP_NAME") ||
      raise "FLY_APP_NAME not available"

  config :libcluster,
    debug: true,
    topologies: [
      fly6pn: [
        strategy: Cluster.Strategy.DNSPoll,
        config: [
          polling_interval: 5_000,
          query: "#{app_name}.internal",
          node_basename: app_name
        ]
      ]
    ]
```

**REMEMBER:** Deploy your updated app so the clustering code is available. Ex: `fly deploy`

This configures `libcluster` to use the `DNSPoll` strategy and look for other deployed apps using the `$FLY_APP_NAME` on the `.internal` private networks.

This assumes that your `rel/env.sh.eex` file is configured to name your Elixir node using the `$FLY_APP_NAME`.

Before it can be clustered, we have to have multiple instances. We'll do that next!

#### _Running Multiple Instances_

There are two ways to run multiple instances.

1. Scale our application to have multiple instances in one region.
2. Add an instance to another region (multiple regions).

Both approaches are valid and our Elixir application doesn't change at all for the approach you choose!

Let's first start with a baseline of our single deployment.

```cmd
fly status
```
```output
...
Instances
ID       VERSION REGION DESIRED STATUS  HEALTH CHECKS      RESTARTS CREATED
f9014bf7 26      sea    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        1h8m ago
```

#### _Scaling in a Single Region_

Let's scale up to 2 instances in our current region.

```cmd
fly scale count 2
```
```output
Count changed to 2
```

Checking on the status we can see what happened.

```cmd
fly status
```
```output
...
Instances
ID       VERSION REGION DESIRED STATUS  HEALTH CHECKS      RESTARTS CREATED
eb4119d3 27      sea    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        39s ago
f9014bf7 27      sea    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        1h13m ago
```

We now have two instances in the same region! That was easy.

Let's make sure they are clustered together. We can check the logs:

```cmd
fly logs
```
```output
...
app[eb4119d3] sea [info] 21:50:21.924 [info] [libcluster:fly6pn] connected to :"fly-elixir@fdaa:0:1da8:a7b:ac2:f901:4bf7:2"
...
```

But that's not as rewarding as seeing it from inside a node. From an IEx shell, we can ask the node we're connected to, what other nodes it can see.

```
fly ssh console
/app/entry remote
```

```elixir
iex(fly-elixir@fdaa:0:1da8:a7b:ac2:f901:4bf7:2)1> Node.list
[:"fly-elixir@fdaa:0:1da8:a7b:ac4:eb41:19d3:2"]
```

I included the IEx prompt because it shows the IP address of the node I'm connected to. Then getting the `Node.list` returns the other node. Our two instances are connected and clustered!

#### _Scaling to Multiple Regions_

Fly makes it super easy to run instances of your applications physically closer to your users. Through the magic of DNS, they will be directed to their nearest region of your application. You can read about [regions](/docs/reference/regions/#welcome-message) here and see the list of regions to choose from.

Starting back from our baseline of a single instance running in `sea` which is Seattle, Washington (US), I'll add the region `ewr` which is Parsippany, NJ (US). This puts an instance on both coasts of the US.

```cmd
fly regions add ewr
```
```output
Region Pool:
ewr
sea
Backup Region:
iad
lax
sjc
vin
```

Looking at the status right now shows that we're only in 1 region because our count is set to 1.

```cmd
fly status
```
```output
...
Instances
ID       VERSION REGION DESIRED STATUS  HEALTH CHECKS      RESTARTS CREATED
cdf6c422 29      sea    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        58s ago
```

Let's add a 2nd instance and see it deploy to `ewr`.

```cmd
fly scale count 2
```
```output
Count changed to 2
```

Now our status shows we have two instances spread across 2 regions!

```cmd
fly status
```
```output
...
Instances
ID       VERSION REGION DESIRED STATUS  HEALTH CHECKS      RESTARTS CREATED
0a8e6666 30      ewr    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        16s ago
cdf6c422 30      sea    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        6m47s ago
```

Let's ensure they are clustered together.

```
fly ssh console
/app/entry remote
```

```elixir
iex(fly-elixir@fdaa:0:1da8:a7b:ac2:cdf6:c422:2)1> Node.list
[:"fly-elixir@fdaa:0:1da8:a7b:ab2:a8e:6666:2"]
```

We have two instances of our application deployed to the West and East coasts of the North American continent and they are clustered together! Our users will automatically be directed to the server nearest them. That is so cool!

Elixir has the built-in super power of Distributed Computing and with very little effort, you can deploy clustered and globally distributed applications yourself!

## Troubleshooting

Some problems are harder to diagnose because they deal with [Elixir releases](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/master/Mix.Tasks.Release.html) or Docker build problems. Typically, you don't run the application that way locally, so you only encounter those problems when it's time to deploy.

Here are a few tips to help diagnose and identify problems.

- Run `mix release` locally on your project.
- Build the Dockerfile locally to verify it builds correctly. `docker build .`
- `config/runtime.exs` for the `:prod` config isn't normally run during local use. Carefully review it.
- `fly logs` to check server logs.
