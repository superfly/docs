Welcome to Fly Launch. To deploy your app on Fly.io for the first time:

<div class="important">
1. [Install flyctl](/docs/flyctl/install/) &ndash; the [open-source](https://github.com/superfly/flyctl+external) Fly.io CLI.

2. Create an account with `fly auth signup` or log in with `fly auth login`.

3. Run `fly launch` from inside your project source directory to create, configure, and (for most apps) deploy a new application.

4. If prompted, run `fly deploy` to deploy your new app (or to redeploy after changes!).
</div>

Fly Launch knows what to do with a [Dockerfile](/docs/languages-and-frameworks/dockerfile/)&mdash;so you can use the tech _you_ love&mdash;and also configures and deploys the following kinds of apps automatically:

<%= partial "/docs/languages-and-frameworks/partials/scanner_guides" %>

See [Launch a new app](/docs/apps/launch/) to learn more about what `fly launch` does.

## Next steps

1. Run `fly status` to show the status of your app and Machines.
2. Run `fly apps open` to open your app in your browser.
3. Learn [the essentials](/docs/getting-started/essentials/) about Fly Launch and Machines.

## Grow and scale

Check out some of the ways you can increase availability, capacity, and performance with Fly.io:

* Follow the blueprint for [extra Machines for more resilient apps](/docs/blueprints/resilient-apps-multiple-machines/)
* Read up on [App availability and resiliency](/docs/reference/app-availability/)
* [Scale Machine CPU and RAM](/docs/apps/scale-machine/) 
* [Scale Machine count](/docs/apps/scale-count/)
* [Automatically start and stop Machines](/docs/apps/autostart-stop/) in response to app traffic
* Try out [Fly GPUs](/docs/gpus/)
