You have an application you want to deploy on Fly.io? You're in the right place.

Welcome to Fly Launch. For most languages and frameworks, you can deploy your app from zero, with the following steps:

<div class="important">
1. [Install flyctl](/docs/flyctl/install/) &ndash; you'll need it.

2. Create an account with `fly auth signup` or login with `fly auth login`.

3. Run `fly launch` from inside your project source directory to create, configure, and (for most apps) deploy a new application.

4. If prompted, run `fly deploy` to deploy your new app (or to redeploy after changes!).
</div>

`fly launch` knows what to do with a [Dockerfile](/docs/languages-and-frameworks/dockerfile/)&mdash;so you can use the tech _you_ love&mdash;and also configures and deploys the following kinds of apps automatically:

<%= partial "/docs/languages-and-frameworks/partials/scanner_guides" %>

Refer to [Launch a new app](/docs/apps/launch/) to learn more about what `fly launch` does.

## Next steps

1. Run `fly status` &ndash; show the status of the application instances.
2. Run `fly apps open` &ndash; open your browser and direct it to your app.
3. Run `fly deploy` &ndash; deploy your app after making changes.
