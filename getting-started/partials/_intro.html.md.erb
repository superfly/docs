Getting an application running on Fly is essentially working out how to package it as a deployable image<%- if defined?(database) %> and attach it to a database<%- end %>.
Once packaged it can be deployed to the Fly infrastructure to run on the global application platform.

In this guide we'll learn how to deploy <%= "#{runtime.downcase.match(/^[aeiou]/) ? "an" : "a"} #{runtime}" %>
<%= locals.key?(:type) ? type : "application" %>
on Fly<%- if locals.key?(:database) %> and connect it to a PostgreSQL database<%- end %>.
