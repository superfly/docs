This section of the Fly docs is all about getting you up and running quickly.

The essential part of this is [Installing Flyctl](/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl) will take you through the, few, steps you need to perform to get the Fly command line available. Don't forget to [create an account and login](/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/) too.

Once that is done, you're ready to take on the Getting Started language and application guides.

## _Language Guides_

Each one of the language guides will take you through creating a simple application, building it with Fly's own builtin builders and deploying it.

* [Node](/docs/getting-started/node/) - Nodejs and Express
* [Go](/docs/getting-started/golang/) - Go and the Gin/Gonic web framework
* [Ruby](/docs/getting-started/ruby/) - Ruby and Sinatra
* [Deno](/docs/getting-started/deno/) - Deno and Dinatra
* [Elixir](/docs/getting-started/elixir/) - Elixir, Phoenix, and Postgres

## _Application Guides_

The application guides show how you can use Fly to deploy existing applications, with no building needed, to get web servers and other services online quickly.

* [Static Web Server](/docs/getting-started/static/) - Serves any and all content in the project directory from a compact web server.

## _Deeper into Fly_

The last part of this section widens your Fly knowledge. There is a tour through the commands you'll need to work with Fly apps through their entire lifecycle and a troubleshooting section for those occasional moments when things don't go as expected.

* [Working with Fly apps](/docs/getting-started/working-with-fly-apps/) covers
  * Finding out about your app - the `info` and `status` commands
  * Viewing app logs
  * Managing secrets for an app
  * Adding hostnames and creating certificates 
* [Troubleshooting Deploments](/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting/) covers
  * Port settings and checking them
  * Reviewing deployment logs
  * Checking your app's host binding
