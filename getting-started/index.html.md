This section of the Fly.io docs is all about getting you up and running quickly.

[Installing Flyctl](/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl) will take you through the, few, steps you need to perform to get the Fly.io command line available. Don't forget to [create an account and login](/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/) too.

Once that is done, you're ready to take on the Getting Started language and application guides.

If you have an app running on Heroku, you may prefer to dip your toes in by cloning it to Fly.io with our [Turboku](https://fly.io/launch/heroku) web launcher. Read about it in the [New Turboku launch post](https://fly.io/blog/new-turboku/).

## Language Guides

Each one of the language guides will take you through creating and deploying a simple application.

* [Node](/docs/getting-started/node/) - Nodejs and Express
* [Go](/docs/getting-started/golang/) - Go and the Gin/Gonic web framework
* [Ruby](/docs/getting-started/ruby/) - Ruby and Sinatra
* [Deno](/docs/getting-started/deno/) - Deno and Dinatra
* [Elixir](/docs/elixir/getting-started) - Elixir, Phoenix, and Postgres

## Application Guides

The application guides show how you can use Fly.io to deploy existing applications, with no building needed, to get web servers and other services online quickly.

* [Static Web Server](/docs/getting-started/static/) - Serves any and all content in the project directory from a compact web server.

## Deeper into Fly

The last part of this section widens your .ioknowledge. There is a tour through the commands you'll need to work with Fly Apps through their entire lifecycle and a troubleshooting section for those occasional moments when things don't go as expected.

* [Working with Fly Apps](/docs/getting-started/working-with-fly-apps/) covers
  * Finding out about your app - the `info` and `status` commands
  * Viewing app logs
  * Managing secrets for an app
  * Adding hostnames and creating certificates 
* [Troubleshooting Deployments](/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting/) covers
  * Port settings and checking them
  * Reviewing deployment logs
  * Checking your app's host binding
