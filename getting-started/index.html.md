This section of the Fly.io docs is all about getting you up and running quickly.

Follow [Hands-on](/docs/hands-on/) which takes you through creating an account, installing `flyctl`, the Fly.io command-line tool, and launching a simple demo app.

If you'd rather jump right in, try [Speedrun](/docs/speedrun/) to launch your own app fast.

Once that's done, check out our in-depth docs:

* **[Language & Framework Guides](/docs/languages-and-frameworks/)**: Comprehensive and starter guides for your favorite languages and frameworks.
* **[Migrate from Heroku](/docs/rails/getting-started/migrate-from-heroku/)**: See how you'd move an existing Rails app and supporting services from Heroku to Fly.io.
* **[Fly Launch](/docs/apps)**: You've tried the `fly launch` command. Now learn how to use all the Fly Launch features that help you manage and run your apps.
* **[Databases & Storage](/docs/database-storage-guides/)**: Options for persistent data storage on the Fly Platform
* **[Fly Machines](/docs/machines/)**: Go deeper with our VMs, and use them to run your projects and tasks.
* **[Reference](/docs/reference)**: The details of how the Fly Platform works.
