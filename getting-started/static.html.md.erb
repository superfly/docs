## _The HelloStatic Site_

Our example will be a be hosting a HTML file. There's no need for any tools. Feel free to add in any HTML files you'd like to serve too.

You can get the code for the example from [the hellostatic Github repository](https://github.com/fly-apps/hellostatic-builtin). Just `git clone https://github.com/fly-apps/hellostatic-builtin` to get a local copy. Here's all the code for our `index.html`:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>
      Hello from Fly
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from Fly with a static web site</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

And that's all we need.

## _Install Flyctl and Login_

We are ready to start working with Fly and that means we need `flyctl`, our CLI app for managing apps on Fly. If you've already installed it, carry on. If not, hop over to [our installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/). Once that's installed you'll want to [login to Fly](/docs/getting-started/login-to-fly/).


## _Configuring the App for Fly_

Each Fly application needs a `fly.toml` file to tell the system how we'd like to deploy it and thats no different for a static web site. The `fly.toml` can be automatically generated with the command `flyctl init` command.

```cmd
flyctl init
```
```output
? App Name (leave blank to use an auto-generated name) hellostatic

? Select organization: Demo (demo)

? Select builder: static
    Web server builtin
? Select Internal Port: 8080

New app created
  Name     = hellostatic
  Owner    = demo
  Version  = 0
  Status   =
  Hostname = <empty>

Wrote config file fly.toml
```

You'll be asked for an application name first. We recommend that you go with the autogenerated names for apps to avoid namespace collisions. We're using `hellostatic` here so you can easily spot it in configuration files.

Next you'll be prompted for an organization. Organizations are a way of sharing applications between Fly users. When you are asked to select an organization, there should be one with your account name; this is your personal organization. Select that.

Flyctl also asks you to select a builder. Builders are responsible for constructing the Docker image of your application which is then deployed to Fly's Firecracker VMs. The simplest to use are the builtin builders, which we recommend you use here. Select Static (Web server Builtin). This is minmal web server image which just serves up content in the image. If you want to know more about the various builders, see [_Builders and Fly_](/docs/reference/builders/).

The last thing you will be asked for an internal port value. This is the port your application communicates over. If set incorrectly, Fly will be unable to connect to the application and it will fail health checks and be terminated. The default shown, 8080, is correct for the builtin builders which, by design, get applications to talk on port 8080. So, hit return and carry on.

## _Inside `fly.toml`_

The `fly.toml` file now contains a default configuration for deploying your static web site. In the process of creating that file, `flyctl` has also created a Fly-side application slot of the same name, "hellostatic". If we look at the `fly.toml` file we can see the name in there:~~

```toml
app = "hellostatic"

[build]
  builtin = "static"


[[services]]
  internal_port = 8080
  protocol = "tcp"

  [services.concurrency]
    hard_limit = 25
    soft_limit = 20

  [[services.ports]]
    handlers = ["http"]
    port = "80"

  [[services.ports]]
    handlers = ["tls", "http"]
    port = "443"

  [[services.tcp_checks]]
    interval = 10000
    timeout = 2000
```

The `flyctl` command will always refer to this file in the current directory if it exists, specifically for the `app` name/value at the start. That name will be used to identify the application to the Fly platform. The rest of the file contains settings to be applied to the application when it deploys.

We'll have more details about these properties as we progress, but for now, it's enough to say that they mostly configure which ports the application will be visible on.

## _Deploying to Fly_

We are now ready to deploy our app to the Fly platform. At the command line, just run:

```cmd
flyctl deploy
```

This will lookup our `fly.toml` file, and get the app name `hellostatic` from there. Then `flyctl` will start the process of deploying our web site to the Fly platform. Flyctl will return you to the command line when it's done.

## _Viewing the Deployed App_

Now the application has been deployed, let's find out more about its deployment. The command `flyctl info` will give you all the essential details.

```cmd
flyctl status
```
```output
App
  Name     = hellostatic
  Owner    = dj
  Version  = 0
  Status   = running
  Hostname = hellostatic.fly.dev

Allocations
ID       VERSION REGION DESIRED STATUS  HEALTH CHECKS      RESTARTS CREATED
99731b01 0       fra    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        2m6s ago
```

## _Connecting to the App_

The quickest way to browse your newly deployed application is with the `flyctl open` command.

```cmd
flyctl open
```
```output
Opening http://hellostatic.fly.dev/
```

Your browser will be sent to the displayed URL. Fly will auto-upgrade this URL to an HTTPS secured URL.

## _Bonus Points_

* If you want to know what IP addresses the app is using, try `flyctl ips list`:

```cmd
flyctl ips list
```
```out
TYPE ADDRESS                              CREATED AT
v4   50.31.246.228                        2m31s ago
v6   2a09:8280:1:4d5b:fc11:3d05:b958:58f9 2m31s ago
```


## _Arrived at Destination_

You have successfully built, deployed, and connected to your first static web server on Fly.
