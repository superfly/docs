Fly Kubernetes is a fully managed Kubernetes service built on the Fly.io platform. It enables you to easily deploy Kubernetes clusters without the hassle of managing and operating the control plane.

## Getting started

To get up and running immediately, try the [Fly Kubernetes quickstart](https://fly.io/docs/kubernetes/fks-quickstart/) guide

## Features

### Fly.io infrastructure

FKS is built on top of Fly.io infrastructure. Compute is backed by Fly Machines, our fast-launching VMs built with Firecracker. Volumes are handled with
Fly Volumes, local, fast NVME drives.  Networking is built on our internal WireGuard mesh with routing performed by Fly Proxy.

### Cluster scalability

Pods are scheduled across our fleet of bare-metal servers, not limited to a specific node. Workloads are automatically distributed across the fleet, enabling a cluster to scale with ease.

### Security

With Fly Kubernetes, you get all the security benefits of our platform.

  * Private network traffic flows over our internal WireGuard mesh, ensuring it is encrypted
  * FKS clusters are secured within a private VPN
  * Compute is built on Firecracker microVMs â€” lightweight and secure virtual machines. This provides improved isolation guarantees ensuring your application code is safe.
  * Volumes are encrypted at rest for additional protection of the data on the volume
  * Secrets are automatically stored in an encrypted vault

### Simple and secure client authentication

Connect to your cluster using kubectl. Clients are authenticated with our API tokens. They expire after an hour and are rotated automatically after expiration.

### Not supported

  * Persistent volumes (coming soon)
  * Sidecars and init processes (coming soon)
  * Horizontal pod autoscaling
  * Gateway API
  * Network policies
  * Daemon sets
  * EmptyDir volumes (coming soon)
