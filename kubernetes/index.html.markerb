Fly Kubernetes (FKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service built on the Fly.io platform. It enables you to easily deploy Kubernetes clusters without the hassle of managing and operating the control plane. Learn more about [why and how we made FKS](https://fly.io/blog/fks/).

## Getting started

To get up and running immediately, try the [Fly Kubernetes quickstart](https://fly.io/docs/kubernetes/fks-quickstart/) guide

## Features

Fly Kubernetes benefits from the features of the Fly.io platform.

### Fly.io infrastructure

FKS is built on top of Fly.io infrastructure:

* Compute is backed by [Fly Machines](/docs/machines/), our fast-launching VMs built with Firecracker. 
* Volumes are handled with [Fly Volumes](/docs/volumes/); local, fast NVMe drives.  
* Networking is built on our [internal WireGuard mesh](/docs/networking/private-networking/#private-network-vpn) with routing performed by Fly Proxy.

### Cluster scalability

Pods are scheduled across our fleet of bare-metal servers, not limited to a specific node. Workloads are automatically distributed across the fleet, enabling a cluster to scale with ease.

### Security

With Fly Kubernetes, you get all the security benefits of our platform.

  * Private network traffic flows over our internal WireGuard mesh, ensuring it is encrypted.
  * FKS clusters are secured within a private VPN.
  * Compute is built on Firecracker microVMs â€” lightweight and secure virtual machines. This provides improved isolation guarantees ensuring your application code is safe.
  * Volumes are encrypted at rest for additional protection of the data on the volume.
  * Secrets are automatically stored in an encrypted vault.

### Simple and secure client authentication

Connect to your cluster using kubectl. Clients are authenticated with our API tokens. They expire after an hour and are rotated automatically after expiration.

### Not supported

There are a few features we don't support yet but are part of the roadmap:

  * Sidecars and init processes
  * EmptyDir volumes
  * Horizontal pod autoscaling
  * StatefulSets
  * Network policies
  * CronJob

Features we don't support:

  * Node affinity
  * Inter-pod (anti) affinity
  * DaemonSets

### Pricing

See the [pricing page](/docs/about/pricing/#fly-kubernetes) for information on FKS pricing.
