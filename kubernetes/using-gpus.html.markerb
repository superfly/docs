Fly Kubernetes is a closed beta. Email us at sales@fly.io for early access.

GPUs are available on Fly Kubernetes. Information about our GPUs can be found in our [Fly GPUs documentation](https://fly.io/docs/gpus/#what-can-i-use-fly-gpus-for).

GPUs are consumed by requesting a GPU resource, similarly to requesting `cpu` or `memory`. There is a custom resource `gpu.fly.io/<gpu type>` that is used to request
GPUs. Note that:

* The available GPU types are: `a100-40gb`, `a100-80gb` and `l40s`. Check the [documentation](https://fly.io/docs/gpus/#regions-with-gpus) for which regions they are available in.
* Pods are deployed in the same region as your cluster. You can place your Pod in a particular region by adding a `fly.io/region: <region>` annotation to your Pod's metadata.
* GPU resource requests should only specify the `limits` section.
* You can specify CPU and memory resources alongside GPU resources. The minimum number of cores supported is 2 and the minimum amount of memory is 4096 MiB. The VMs
deployed will always be performance Machines.
* The valid number of GPUs you can request are: 1, 2, 4 and 8.
* You can only request one type of GPU at a time

Below is an example of a Pod with a GPU:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  annotations:
    fly.io/region: ams # optional
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
      resources:
        limits:
          gpu.fly.io/a100-80gb: 1
```

This will deploy a GPU Machine with the size `a100-80gb` with 1 GPU core in the region `ams`.
