That's it! Run `fly open` to see your deployed app in action.

Try a few other commands:

* [`fly logs`](/docs/flyctl/logs/) - Tail your application logs
* [`fly status`](/docs/flyctl/status/) - View your app's current deployment status
* [`fly ssh console`](/docs/flyctl/ssh-console/) - Open a terminal on your VM
* [`fly deploy`](/docs/flyctl/deploy/) - Deploy the application after making changes
