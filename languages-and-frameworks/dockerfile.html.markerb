You already have a project wrapped up in a [docker container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)? Great! Just deploy that!

The `fly launch` command detects your Dockerfile and builds it. If you have Docker running locally, it builds it on your machine. If not, it builds it on a Fly build machine. Once your container is built, it's deployed! Need some extra config? No sweat, we've got you covered. Let's take a look.

```cmd
fly launch
```
```output
...
Detected a Dockerfile app
? Choose an app name (leave blank to generate one):
? Select Organization: Mark Ericksen (personal)
...

? Choose a region for deployment: Los Angeles, California (US) (lax)
App will use 'lax' region as primary

Created app 'wispy-breeze-3322' in organization 'personal'
Admin URL: https://fly.io/apps/wispy-breeze-3322
Hostname: wispy-breeze-3322.fly.dev
? Would you like to set up a Postgresql database now? No
? Would you like to set up an Upstash Redis database now? No
Wrote config file fly.toml
? Would you like to deploy now?
```

Let `fly launch` generate an app name for you or pick your own.

Select the Fly.io [region](https://fly.io/docs/reference/regions/) to deploy to.

The launch command generates a `fly.toml` file for your project with the settings. You can deploy right away, or add some config first.

## _Config First!_

Most Dockerfiles expect some configuration settings through `ENV`. The generated `fly.toml` file has a place for you to add your custom `ENV` settings. It's the `[env]` block.

```toml
[env]
  MY_SPECIAL_ENV = "some_value"
  MAX_PLAYER_COUNT = "15"
```

Add the values your Dockerfile or container requires.

Sometimes you have secrets that shouldn't be checked in to `git` or shared publicly. For those settings, you can set them using [`fly secrets`](https://fly.io/docs/reference/secrets/#setting-secrets).

```cmd
flyctl secrets set MY_SECRET=romance
```
```output
Secrets are staged for the first deployment
```

You can list the secrets you've already set using `fly secrets list`

```cmd
fly secrets list
```
```
NAME      DIGEST                           DATE
MY_SECRET b9e37b7b239ee4aefc75352fe3fa6dc6 1m20s ago
```

The values aren't displayed since they are secret!

## _Deploy Your App_

If you didn't previously deploy the app, you can do that now.

```cmd
fly deploy
```
```output
Validating /Users/someone/project/fly.toml
Platform: machines
âœ“ Configuration is valid
==> Building image
Remote builder fly-builder-restless-shadow-3063 ready
==> Creating build context
--> Creating build context done
==> Building image with Docker
--> docker host: 20.10.12 linux x86_64
Sending build context to Docker daemon     346B
...
  Finished deploying

Visit your newly deployed app at https://wispy-breeze-3322.fly.dev/
```

By default, `fly deploy` builds the image using a remote builder. If you have Docker running locally and want to build locally, then run `fly deploy --local-only`. Once your container is built, it's deployed!

## _Open Your App_

Run `fly apps open` to open your deployed app in a browser.

You're off and running!

## _Taking it Further_

Lots of applications deployed in a container have some state that they want to keep. Here are a couple resources to check out for ways to do that.

- **[Persistent Volumes:](https://fly.io/docs/volumes/)** You can create [persistent volumes](https://fly.io/docs/volumes/) that you can mount into your container for reading and writing data that changes but isn't blown away when you deploy again.
- **[Postgres Database:](https://fly.io/docs/reference/postgres/#about-postgres-on-fly)** Deploy a [Fly Postgres Database](https://fly.io/docs/reference/postgres/#about-postgres-on-fly). It automatically creates a `DATABASE_URL` ENV when you attach it to your app.
