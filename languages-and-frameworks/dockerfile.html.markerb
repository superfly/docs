Fly Launch can deploy your app from a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/+external).

The `fly launch` command detects your Dockerfile, builds it, and then deploys your app. Need some extra config? No sweat, we've got you covered.

## Create and configure your app

Run `fly launch` from your project's source directory.

<div class="important icon">
If you want to configure more than the basic settings, things like secrets or environment variables for example, run `fly launch --no-deploy` so that you can [edit the `fly.toml` file](#more-config) before the first deployment.

```cmd
fly launch
```
```output
Scanning source code
Detected a Dockerfile app
Creating app in /Users/name/test/my-app-name
We're about to launch your app on Fly.io. Here's what you're getting:

Organization: MyOrg                  (fly launch defaults to the personal org)
Name:         my-app-name            (derived from your directory name)
Region:       Secaucus, NJ (US)      (this is the fastest region for you)
App Machines: shared-cpu-1x, 1GB RAM (most apps need about 1GB of RAM)
Postgres:     <none>                 (not requested)
Redis:        <none>                 (not requested)

? Do you want to tweak these settings before proceeding? Yes
```

Type `n` if you're happy with the defaults listed, otherwise type `y` to open the Fly Launch web page and edit your settings, including:

* Name: Keep the default app name or enter your own.

* Region: Keep the fastest [region](/docs/reference/regions/) (the value of `primary_region` in the `fly.toml` file) as chosen by Fly Launch, or select a different region to deploy to.

* Services: The port for services (the value of `internal_port` in the `fly.toml` file) depends on the `EXPOSE` instruction in your Dockerfile. The default port when the `fly launch` command doesn't find ports set in a Dockerfile is `8080`.

* You can also set a default Machine size and memory, and add and configure Postgres or Redis.

After you click **Confirm Settings**, Fly Launch creates your app, generates a `fly.toml` file for your project with the settings, and then deploys the app.

### Add environment variables and secrets

Most Dockerfiles expect some configuration settings through `ENV`. Add your custom `ENV` settings to the `[env]` section of the generated `fly.toml` file. For example:

```toml
[env]
  MY_SPECIAL_ENV = "some_value"
  MAX_PLAYER_COUNT = "15"
```

Add the values your Dockerfile requires.

Sometimes you have secrets that shouldn't be checked in to `git` or shared publicly. You can set secrets using the [`fly secrets`](/docs/apps/secrets/#set-secrets) command. For example:

```cmd
flyctl secrets set MY_SECRET=romance
```
```output
Secrets are staged for the first deployment
```

You can list the secrets you've already set using `fly secrets list`. For example:

```cmd
fly secrets list
```
```
NAME      DIGEST                           DATE
MY_SECRET b9e37b7b239ee4aefc75352fe3fa6dc6 1m20s ago
```

The values aren't displayed, since they're secret!

### Deploy your app

If you didn't deploy the new app, or you've made changes and want to redeploy, then you can do that now.

```cmd
fly deploy
```
```output

By default, `fly deploy` builds the image using a remote builder. If you have Docker running locally and want to build locally, then run `fly deploy --local-only`. After the image is built, the app gets deployed.

### Open your app

Run `fly apps open`, or just go to the URL specified in the output, to open your deployed app in a browser.

## Stateful apps

Lots of apps have some state that they want to keep. Learn more about the options for [databases and storage](docs/database-storage-guides/) on Fly.io.

## Grow and scale

Check out some of the ways you can increase availability, capacity, and performance with Fly.io:

* Follow the blueprint for [extra Machines for more resilient apps](/docs/blueprints/resilient-apps-multiple-machines/)
* Read up on [App availability and resiliency](/docs/reference/app-availability/)
* [Autoscale Machines based on load or custom metrics](/docs/reference/autoscaling/)
* [Scale Machine CPU and RAM](/docs/apps/scale-machine/) 
* [Scale Machine count](/docs/apps/scale-count/)
* Try out [Fly GPUs](/docs/gpus/)
