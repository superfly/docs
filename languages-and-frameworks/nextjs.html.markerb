You can deploy your [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) app on Fly with minimal effort, our CLI will do the heavy lifting. You can use your existing NextJS app or you can [create one using the tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) then come back here to deploy your app.

## _Generate the NextJS app_

If you just want to see how Fly deployment works, follow these steps.

<%= partial "partials/flyctl" %>

Now let's launch your NextJS app.

<%= partial "partials/launch", locals: { detected: "NextJS", app_name: app_name } %>

<%= partial "partials/launched" %>

## _What about build time environment variables?_

If you're an NextJS user you might know that it supports [exposing environment variables to the browser](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables#exposing-environment-variables-to-the-browser) using variables with name starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

For our build system to understand that you need to tweak two sections we generate for you, `fly.toml` and our `Dockerfile`. 

Search for `[build.args]` on your `fly.toml` and add the variables you need there.

```toml
[build.args]
  NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLE="This is the value"
  NEXT_PUBLIC_OTHER="Other value"
```

Then go to your `Dockerfile` and add `ARG` instructions before your `yarn build` like this:

```Dockerfile
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLE
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_OTHER

# Your yarn build should come after those ARGs
```
