<%= partial "partials/intro", locals: { runtime: "static", type: "site" } %>

In this demonstration, we'll use [nginx](https://nginx.org), the world's most popular web server to serve a few static files with very little configuration. We'll provide a Dockerfile and our content for Fly to transmogrify into a web server running in a VM.

You can clone all the files needed for this example from [the hello-static GitHub repository](https://github.com/fly-apps/hello-static) to a local directory:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/fly-apps/hello-static
```

Alternatively, you can create all the files manually as you work through this guide.

## _Install flyctl and login_

To configure our application and deploy it on Fly.io, we need `flyctl`, our CLI app for managing apps on Fly. If you've already installed it, carry on. If not, hop over to [our installation guide](/docs/flyctl/install/). Once that's installed you'll want to [log in to Fly](/docs/getting-started/sign-up-sign-in/).

## _Putting the app together_

At this point, if you have a local clone of the `hello-static` repository, you could go ahead and run `fly launch` from its root directory and get the static site deployed without further ado. But that wouldn't be very illuminating. Let's go through what's included in the example repository and why.

If you cloned the repository, your new app already has its own directory. Otherwise, create one. This isn't just for tidiness, or for letting `flyctl` detect your app by the `fly.toml` in the working directory (although these are good reasons). It also ensures that no extra files get included in the [build context](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) when the Docker image gets built.

We'll do everything from within this directory:

```cmd
cd hello-static
```

### _The Site_

Our example will be a simple static site. That can be as trivial as a single `index.html` file. Let's make it only slightly more complicated by writing two HTML files and having them link to each other.

Put these HTML files into a subdirectory of their own, called `public`. Files in this directory are the ones our nginx server will serve. Create the `hello-static/public` directory if needed.

Here's `index.html`, which is the landing page:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>
      Hello from Fly
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from Fly with a static web site</h1>
      <p>Or <a href="goodbye.html">goodbye.</a></p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here's `goodbye.html`.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>
      Still Hello from Fly
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>You say goodbye</h1>
      <p>But I say <a href="/">hello.</a></p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### _The Dockerfile_

nginx can be run in a container, and the official nginx image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/). This is super convenient for us, because Fly apps use container images!

We can use the nginx image as a base image. We just have to copy our site's files to `/usr/share/nginx/html` in the image.

Here's our Dockerfile to do that:

```docker
FROM nginx:alpine

COPY public /usr/share/nginx/html
```

The Dockerfile should be placed in the working directory (here, `hello-static`).

### _Configuring the App for Fly.io_

We set the initial configuration for the app by running `flyctl launch`. This takes care of setting the app name, the Fly.io organization it belongs to, and a region to deploy to. It also generates a `fly.toml` file
with more configuration settings.

The `hello-static` repository contains a `fly.toml` that will be detected by `flyctl launch`; you can use it to configure your app. Otherwise, a new `fly.toml` will be generated with `flyctl launch`, and we can edit it.

```cmd
flyctl launch
```
```output

We're about to launch your app on Fly.io. Here's what you're getting:

Organization: Jon Phenow                         (fly launch defaults to the personal org)
Name:         hello-static                       (generated)
Region:       Denver, Colorado (US)              (this is the fastest region for you)
App Machines: shared-cpu-1x, 1GB RAM             (most apps need about 1GB of RAM)

```

This has configured the app with some default parameters, generated a `fly.toml`, attached a shared IPv4, created a dedicated IPv6, and deployed our image file for us.

Before the app will work though, we need to do one more thing. nginx listens on port 80 by default, but the default `fly.toml` assumes port 8080. Edit `internal_port` in the [`services`](/docs/reference/configuration/#the-http_service-section) section to reflect this:

```toml
[http_service]
  internal_port = 80
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = 'stop'
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0
  processes = ['app']
  ```

Now we're ready to deploy:

```cmd
flyctl deploy
```

The output should end something like this, if everything has gone well:
