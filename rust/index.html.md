Fly is a great place to launch your Rust applications, especially if you plan on running them on multiple servers around the world so your users have a fast, snappy, low-latency experience.

If you have questions or comments about running Rust applications on Fly.io, create a new topic in [the Fly.io community Forum](https://community.fly.io/) and tag it with "rust" so the right people from Fly.io and our community can give you the support you need. 

## Getting Started

Run through the [Axum Speedrun](/docs/rust/frameworks/axum) to get a feel for what it's like to deploy to Fly.

## The Basics

[The Basics](/docs/rust/the-basics/) covers everything you need to set up, run, and manage production Rust apps on Fly. These documents also identify some common problems you may encounter and provides some pointers on how to resolve them.
