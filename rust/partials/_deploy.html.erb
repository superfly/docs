And with that you can deploy the app!

```cmd
fly launch
```

```output

We're about to launch your app on Fly.io. Here's what you're getting:

Organization: Your Name              (fly launch defaults to the personal org)
Name:         [app-name]             (derived from your directory name)
Region:       Amsterdam, Netherlands (this is the fastest region for you)
App Machines: shared-cpu-1x, 1GB RAM (most apps need about 1GB of RAM)
Postgres:     <none>                 (not requested)
Redis:        <none>                 (not requested)
Sentry:       false                  (not requested)

Watch your deployment at https://fly.io/apps/[app-name]/monitoring
...

Visit your newly deployed app at https://[app-name].fly.dev/
```

This will generate a `fly.toml` file with the configuration for your app and a Dockerfile that uses [cargo chef](/docs/rust/the-basics/cargo-chef).
Refer to the [fly.toml docs](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/) for more configuration options.

To deploy a new version of your app, simply run `fly deploy` in the project directory.

You can check out the full (yet minimal) example in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/superfly/rust-templates/tree/<%= runtime %>) for a reference.
