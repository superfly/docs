## Choosing an approach to storage

Often the solution to persistent data storage is to connect your Fly App to a separate database or object store.

Fly.io offers a [deploy-it-yourself Postgres app](/docs/postgres/) with some tools to make it easier to manage yourself.

If you need hardware-local disk storage on your Machines&mdash;for example, if your Fly App _is_ a database (or if you want to use [LiteFS](/docs/litefs))&mdash;then you'll want to use [Fly Volumes](/docs/volumes/).

Explore these, and further options, for data storage in the following sections.

## Fly Volumes - Disk Storage

Anything an App VM writes to its root disk is ephemeral: when the VM is redeployed, the root file system is rebuilt using its Docker image, deleting any data written to it since it was started up. This is fine for `/tmp` files, but most apps need to keep state in a database or another form of persistent storage.

- **[Fly Volumes](/docs/volumes/)** - Persistent storage on Fly.io is provided by Fly Volumes. You can use Volumes on an App directly, or run a separate database App with Volume storage and connect an App to that. A Fly Volume is a slice of NVMe disk storage attached to the server that hosts your Machine. Volumes have pros and cons, and you should read the [Fly volumes overview](/docs/reference/volumes/) before deciding whether they're the best solution for your use case.

## Fly.io Database Projects

These are projects that we develop and support. They're not managed services; you can deploy them yourself as Fly Apps.

- **[Fly Postgres](/docs/postgres/)** - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a popular relational database. When you deploy an App on Fly.io, we give you the option to launch a Fly Postgres App and attach it to your App. We provide tools for deployment and management; you manage the cluster once it's deployed.
- **[LiteFS for SQLite](/docs/litefs/)** - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is a very lightweight file-based database. [LiteFS](/docs/litefs/) is a distributed file system that transparently replicates SQLite databases. You deploy it and you manage it.

## Partner Integrations Running on Fly.io

- **[Upstash for Redis](/docs/reference/redis/)** - [Redis](https://redis.io/) is an in-memory database commonly used for caching. A managed service by [Upstash](https://upstash.com/).

## Other Storage Apps

If your application calls for a different solution, you can deploy it yourself as an App on Fly.io. These examples can help you get started with other popular storage options.

- **[MySQL and MariaDB](/docs/app-guides/mysql-on-fly/)** - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is a popular relational database. [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) is a community fork of MySQL and is compatible with MySQL.

- **[EdgeDB](/docs/app-guides/edgedb/)** - [EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com/) is a graph-relational database that runs on top of Postgres.

- **[MinIO Object Storage](/docs/app-guides/minio/)** - [MinIO](https://min.io/) is software that allows you to self-host S3-compatible storage.
