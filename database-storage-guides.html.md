The solution to persistent data storage is to usually connect your Fly App to a separate database or object store. If you need hardware-local disk storage on your Machines&mdash;for example, if your Fly App _is_ a database or if you want to use [LiteFS](/docs/litefs)&mdash;then you can use [Fly Volumes](/docs/volumes/).

## Fly Volumes - Disk storage

The Fly Machines in your app provide ephemeral storage, so you get a blank slate on every startup. For persistent storage on Fly.io, use Fly Volumes. You can attach volumes on an app directly, or run a separate database app with volume storage and connect an app to that. 

- **[Fly Volumes](/docs/volumes/):** A Fly Volume is a slice of NVMe disk storage attached to the server that hosts your Machine. Read the [Fly Volumes overview](/docs/volumes/overview/) to find out if volumes are the best solution for your use case.

## Managed database services

_Managed database services from our extension partners._

- **[Supabase Postgres (public alpha)](/docs/reference/supabase/)** - [Supabase](https://supabase.com/database+external) Postgres is a full-featured and fully-managed Postgres database on Fly.io infrastructure.

- **[Upstash for Redis](/docs/reference/redis/)** - [Redis](https://redis.io/+external) is an in-memory database commonly used for caching. A managed service by [Upstash](https://upstash.com/+external).

## Fly.io databases

_These are not managed services; you deploy and manage them yourself as Fly Apps._

- **[Fly Postgres](/docs/postgres/)** - Our Postgres app provides a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/+external) database with some tools to make it easier to manage yourself. When you deploy an App on Fly.io, we give you the option to launch a Fly Postgres App and attach it to your App.

- **[LiteFS for SQLite](/docs/litefs/)** - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html+external) is a very lightweight file-based database. [LiteFS](/docs/litefs/) is a distributed file system that transparently replicates SQLite databases. You deploy it and you manage it.

## Other database and storage options

_Examples to help you get started with other popular storage options._

- **[MySQL and MariaDB](/docs/app-guides/mysql-on-fly/)** - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/+external) is a popular relational database. [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/+external) is a community fork of MySQL and is compatible with MySQL.

- **[EdgeDB](/docs/app-guides/edgedb/)** - [EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com/+external) is a graph-relational database that runs on top of Postgres.

- **[MinIO Object Storage](/docs/app-guides/minio/)** - [MinIO](https://min.io/+external) is software that allows you to self-host S3-compatible storage.
