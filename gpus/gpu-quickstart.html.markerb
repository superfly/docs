1. You can use any base image for your Dockerfile, but it is convenient to base it on `ubuntu:22.04` and install libraries from NVIDIA's official apt repository: `RUN apt install -y cuda-nvcc-12-2 libcublas-12-2 libcudnn8` is usually enough.

    <div class = "note icon">
    **Notes**:
    - Do not install meta packages like: `cuda-runtime-*`
    - `cuda-libraries-12-2` is good, but a bulky start. Once you know what libs are needed at build and runtime, please pick accordingly to optimize final image size.
    - Use multi-stage docker builds as much as possible.
    </div>

1. From flyctl, create an app using either `fly launch` or `fly apps create`.

    <div class="note icon">
    **Note**: GPUs are not available in all regions. There are these GPU types available: Nvidia A10, L40S, A100-PCIe-40GB, and A100-SXM4-80GB.
    
    <br>Currently GPUs are available in the following regions:
    - `a10`: `ord`
    - `l40s`: `ord`
    - `a100-40gb`: `ord`
    - `a100-80gb`: `iad`, `sjc`, `syd`
    </div>

1. Create or modify the `fly.toml` config file in the project source directory, replacing values with your own:

    ```toml
    app = "my-gpu-app"
    primary_region = "ord"
    vm.size = "a100-40gb"

    # Use a volume to store LLMs or any big file that doesn't fit in a Docker image
    [[mounts]]
    source = "data"
    destination = "/data"

    [http_service]
    internal_port = 8080
    auto_stop_machines = false
    ```

    <div class="note icon">
    **Notes**:
    - Make sure `vm.size` is set in `fly.toml`, valid values are `a10`, `l40s`, `a100-40gb` and `a100-80gb`.
    - Make sure to include a `[[mounts]]` section in `fly.toml`.
    - The volume gets created automatically by `fly deploy`.
    - Use the volume to store the models and large files that can't be shipped as a docker image.
    </div>


1. Deploy your app:

    ```cmd
    fly deploy
    ```

That's pretty much it to get an app running with a Machine on a GPU.

## Volumes and GPU Machines

<div class="important icon">
**Important**: If you create any additional volumes, they need to be created with the same constraints as your Machine.
</div>

Here's an example of creating a new one hundred gigabyte volume for storing ML models in the `ord` region, on a machine with a GPU:

```cmd
fly volumes create models \
  --size 100 \
  --vm-gpu-kind a100-40gb \
  --region ord
```

Example Dockerfile:

```
FROM ubuntu:22.04 as base
RUN apt update -q && apt install -y ca-certificates wget && \
    wget -qO /cuda-keyring.deb https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb && \
    dpkg -i /cuda-keyring.deb && apt update -q

FROM base as builder
RUN apt install -y --no-install-recommends git cuda-nvcc-12-2
RUN git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples.git /cuda-samples
RUN cd /cuda-samples/Samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery && \
    make && install -m 755 deviceQuery /usr/local/bin

FROM base as runtime
#RUN apt install -y --no-install-recommends libcudnn8 libcublas-12-2
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bin/deviceQuery /usr/local/bin/deviceQuery
CMD ["sleep", "inf"]
```
