Production applications benefit from active monitoring. Sometimes we need to know what's happening right now with RAM resources and sometimes we need to know what which user accessed a specific resource last week.

## Metrics

Fly.io provides metrics for your applications at [https://fly-metrics.net](https://fly-metrics.net).

In addition to viewing the provided metrics, your applications can publish their own custom metrics!

You can read all about viewing metrics (via Grafana or over its API) and publishing your own metrics [in the Metrics documentation](/docs/metrics-and-logs/metrics/).

## Logs
