We've retired our web-based launchers for individual apps like Jupyter and code-server. You can launch these apps yourself, with the `fly launch` command. Apps that have their own official Docker images are especially convenient. Here are a couple of places to start:

[Speedrun: Launch on Fly.io](/docs/getting-started/launch/)

[Deploy via Dockerfile](/docs/languages-and-frameworks/dockerfile/)
