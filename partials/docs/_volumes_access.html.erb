Access and write to a volume on a Machine just like a regular directory. 

For Machines managed with Fly Launch, the `destination` under `[mounts]` in `fly.toml` is the path for the mounted volumes. 

For unmanaged Machines, you specify the mount path when you [add a volume to a cloned Machine](#add-a-volume-to-an-unmanaged-machine) or [create a Machine and attach a volume](/docs/machines/flyctl/fly-machine-run/#mount-a-fly-volume).
