### Public buckets

By default, buckets are private. If you need to serve public assets like images or JavaScript files, create a *public bucket*:

```cmd
fly storage create --public
```

You can also make a public bucket private.

```cmd
fly storage update mybucket --private
```

Currently, buckets must be public or private. ACL settings will be ignored by the Tigris API.
