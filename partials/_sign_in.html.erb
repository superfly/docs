If you already have a Fly.io account, all you need to do is sign in with flyctl. To sign in, run:

```cmd
fly auth login
```

When your browser opens to the Fly.io sign-in screen, enter your user name and password to sign in. If you signed up with GitHub, then click `Sign in with GitHub` to sign in.

Microsoft WSL users may need to run the following command to make this work:

```cmd
ln -s /usr/bin/wslview /usr/local/bin/xdg-open
```

Whichever route you take you will be returned to your command line, ready to use Fly.io.
