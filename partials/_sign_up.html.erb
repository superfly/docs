If it’s your first time using Fly.io, you’ll need to sign up for an account. To sign up, run:

```cmd
fly auth signup
```

This will take you to the sign-up page where you can sign up in one of the following ways:

* **Sign up with email**: Enter your name, email and password.

* **Sign up with Google**: Use your Google account to sign in to Fly.io.

* **Sign up with GitHub**: Use your GitHub to sign in to Fly.io. Look out for the confirmation email we'll send you, which will give you a link to set a password; you'll need a password set so we can actively verify that it is you for some Fly.io operations.

You will also be prompted for credit card payment information, required for charges outside the free allowances on Fly.io. See [Pricing](/docs/about/pricing) for more details.

Whichever route you take you will be signed up, signed in, and returned to your command line, ready to use Fly.io.
