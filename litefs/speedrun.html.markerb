This guide will get your app up and running with LiteFS on Fly.io as
fast as possible. If you run into any issues with this guide, or you'd like
some more details or a slower pace, check out the [Getting Started doc][] instead.

You can also take a look at [the docs for your framework][Framework docs]
to see if LiteFS is supported by `fly launch`.

<div class="callout">
This guide assumes you already have a working `Dockerfile` for
your app. If not, get that working (with regular sqlite), and then come
back here!

## Let's do this!

### 1. Configure litefs.yml

Copy [the sample `litefs.yml` file](https://github.com/superfly/litefs-example/blob/main/fly-io-config/etc/litefs.yml)
from the `litefs-example` repo, and make the following updates:

* Update from `8081` in `proxy.target` to whatever port your app listens on
* Update `exec[0].cmd` to the command that runs your app

### 2. Update your Dockerfile

Install LiteFS dependencies:

```dockerfile
# for alpine-based images
RUN apk add ca-certificates fuse3 sqlite
# or for debian/ubuntu-based images
RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y ca-certificates fuse3 sqlite3
```

Copy in the LiteFS binary:

```dockerfile
COPY --from=flyio/litefs:0.5 /usr/local/bin/litefs /usr/local/bin/litefs
```

Update the `ENTRYPOINT` (or `CMD`):

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT litefs mount
```

### 3. Set up & deploy to the Fly Platform

Create a volume:

```sh
fly volumes create litefs --size 10
```

Create your app config, but don't deploy it (say no when it asks):

```sh
fly launch
```

Configure consul (this sets the `FLY_CONSUL_URL` secret for your app, which is required for LitefS leases):

```sh
fly consul attach
```

Update your `fly.toml` file to mount your volume:

```yml
[mounts]
  source = "litefs"
  destination = "/var/lib/litefs"
```

Deploy your app:

```sh
fly deploy
```

TADA! You (hopefully) now have an app running with LiteFS! If you're having trouble, you can
ask for help in [the Fly community](https://community.fly.io).

### 4. Add some replicas in other regions

LiteFS isn't *super* useful if you're running only one node. So, add some
more nodes in more regions!

```sh
# Add a clone in London
fly m clone --select --region lhr
# Add a clone in Sydney
fly m clone --select --region syd
```
