title: LiteFS - Distributed SQLite
layout: docs
nav: litefs
---

LiteFS is a distributed file system that transparently replicates SQLite
databases. You can run your application like it's running against a local
on-disk SQLite database but behind the scenes the database is replicated to all
the nodes in your cluster. With LiteFS, you can run your database right next to your
application on the edge. You can run LiteFS anywhere!

## Project status

LiteFS is stable and running in production environments. The project is still
pre-1.0 so APIs may change and features could be removed. Please remember that
all software has bugs so we recommend you set up [regular off-site backups][backup] 
in case of malfunction or disk corruption.

## Exploring our guides

You can get up and running quickly with one of our guides:

- [Speedrun: Adding LiteFS to your app](/docs/litefs/speedrun) the fastest way to get started with LiteFS on Fly.io.

- [Getting Started on Fly.io][] helps you add LiteFS to an existing application and deploy to Fly.io. This guide
provides more details and explanation than the Speedrun.

- [Getting Started with Docker][] helps you add LiteFS to an existing application that you want to run outside of Fly.io.

- [How LiteFS Works][] explains the concepts behind LiteFS.
