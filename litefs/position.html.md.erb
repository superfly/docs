Each database created in LiteFS maintains a position in their replication log.
The position is a combination of a monotonically incrementing transaction ID
(TXID) and a rolling checksum of the database contents.

You can view the position for any database by reading the `-pos` suffixed file
next to the database file. For example, if you have a database named `db` then
you can read from a file called `db-pos`:

```sh
$ cat /path/to/mnt/db-pos
00000000002df417/ce552e44f23fbbdd
```

The TXID is representated a 16-character hex-encoded `uint64`. The checksum is
encoded as a 16-character hex-encoded `uint64`. These are concatenated using
a slash and a newline is appended at the end.

### Using TXID to handle consistency

Clients can use the TXID if they wish to ensure that the database state is
consistent across requests to different nodes. For example, a write to the
primary may occur at TXID 100. If a subsequent request to a replica is
performed, then the client can pass the TXID to the application and have it
wait until it reaches or surpasses transaction ID 100.


### Using a time-delay to handle consistency

Another approach is to redirect subsequent reads from a client to the
primary for a few seconds after a write occurs. This is typically enough time
to ensure that changes from the write are copied to the replica before it begins
serving read requests to the client again. However, this provides weaker
consistency guarantees over checking with the TXID in the position file since
replication is not guaranteed to occur within a specified time frame.
