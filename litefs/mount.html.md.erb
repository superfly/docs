## Overview

The `mount` command will mount a LiteFS directory via FUSE and begin communicating
with the LiteFS cluster. The mount will be accessible once the node becomes the
primary or is able to connect and sync with the primary.

Most options are specified in the [litefs.yml config file](config).


## Usage

```sh
litefs mount [arguments]
```

## Arguments

### Configuration

A specific config file path can be specified using the `-config` flag. If the
config file cannot be read from this path, LiteFS will exit with an error and
not attempt to search the other config paths.

Environment variable expansion can be disabled via the `-no-expand-env` flag.


```
  -config string
      config file path
  -no-expand-env
      do not expand env vars in config
```


### Debugging

These debugging flags can produce verbose output so they are not recommended for
regular use. The `-fuse.debug` flag enables logging for every FUSE request and
response. This can also be enabled via the config file.

The `-tracing` flag enables logging for LiteFS-specific events such as reading
and writing database pages or acquiring and releasing locks. This flag enables
output to `STDOUT` but a disk-based tracing log can be enabled via the config
file.

```
  -fuse.debug
      enable FUSE debug logging
  -tracing
      enable trace logging to stdout
```
