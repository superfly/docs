## Overview

This guide will walk you through the steps of getting a LiteFS cluster up and
running on Fly.io.

For a full, working example of a LiteFS application, please see the
[litefs-example][] repository.

## Creating a LiteFS Cloud Cluster (optional)

## Configuring LiteFS

Most configuration options for LiteFS are set via a YAML configuration file
called `litefs.yml`. This file is typically placed in `/etc/litefs.yml`, but
you can change the path by using the `-config` flag.

Take a look at
[the litefs.yml file](https://github.com/superfly/litefs-example/blob/main/fly-io-config/etc/litefs.yml)
in the `litefs-example` repo for a full example, or follow along with the
rest of this section for a more detailed explanation!

### File system

Let's first set two fields to tell LiteFS where to mount its file system and
where to store its internal data.

```yml
# This directory is where your application will access the database.
fuse:
  dir: "/litefs"

# This directory is where LiteFS will store internal data.
# You must place this directory on a persistent volume.
data:
  dir: "/var/lib/litefs"
```

If you're running on Fly.io, you should create a volume:

```sh
fly volumes create litefs --size 10
```

And then specify it as a mount in your `fly.toml`:

```toml
[mounts]
  source = "litefs"
  destination = "/var/lib/litefs"
```


### Lease configuration

LiteFS only allows a single node to be the _primary_ at any given time. The
primary node is the only one that can write data to the database. The other
nodes are called _replicas_ and they provide a read-only copy.

The primary is determined by using a [_distributed lease_](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/time-bound-lease.html).
In this guide, we'll be using a [Consul][] lease as it allows the primary to
automatically failover in order to have high write availability. You can add a
Consul URL to your app with:

```
fly consul attach
```

That will set a `FLY_CONSUL_URL` secret for the app, which will have the cluster url.

Then in your `litefs.yml`, set the `lease` section:

```yml
lease:
  type: "consul"

  # Specifies if this node can become primary. The expression below evaluates
  # to true on nodes that are run in the primary region. Nodes in other regions
  # act as non-candidate, read-only replicas.
  candidate: ${FLY_REGION == PRIMARY_REGION}
  
  # If true, then the node will automatically become primary after it has
  # connected with the cluster and sync'd up. This makes it easier to run
  # migrations on start up.
  promote: true
  
  # The API URL that other nodes will use to connect to this node.
  advertise-url: "http://${FLY_ALLOC_ID}.vm.${FLY_APP_NAME}.internal:20202"

  consul:
    # The URL of the Consul cluster.
    url: "${FLY_CONSUL_URL}"

    # A unique key shared by all nodes in the LiteFS cluster.
    # Change this if you are running multiple clusters in a single app!
    key: "${FLY_APP_NAME}/primary"
```

You can find more details in the [lease management][] section of the configuration
guide.

### LiteFS Cloud Configuration

If you're using LiteFS Cloud for backups, you'll need to provide a LiteFS Cloud
API authentication token, which you got when you created the cluster (or you can
create a new one from [the LiteFS Cloud section][LiteFS Cloud Dashboard] in Fly.io
dashboard).

You should add this as a secret for your application named `LITEFS_CLOUD_TOKEN` with:

```cmd
fly secrets set LITEFS_CLOUD_TOKEN=$(litefs cloud auth token)
```

### Configuring the proxy

LiteFS requires that all writes occur on the primary node, which means
that applications need to redirect write requests to the current primary. It's
also possible to issue a write to the primary and then read from a replica
before the change is propagated to that replica.

Most web applications can take advantage of a thin, built-in proxy
inside LiteFS that automatically handles these write redirection and replica
consistency issues. In order to make use of this proxy, your application needs
to follow these rules:

- `GET` requests never perform write operations (e.g. `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, etc).

- Clients have cookies enabled.

To configure the proxy, you'll need to set the `proxy` section in the config file:

```yml
proxy:
  # Bind address for the proxy to listen on.
  addr: ":8080"

  # Hostport of your application - replace 8081 with whatever port
  # your application is listening on!
  target: "localhost:8081"

  # Filename of the SQLite database you want to use for TXID tracking.
  db: "my.db"
```

You can find more details on the [proxy configuration guide][].
