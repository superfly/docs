## Overview

LiteFS uses a single primary node for writing data and that primary node
replicates out to other replica nodes for fast reads. This poses two issues
for applications:

1. Requests that write data must be forwarded to the primary.

2. Requests that only read data should wait until previous writes have been
   replicated to a node before reading from that node.

LiteFS provides a built-in HTTP proxy server that can handle these issues
automatically for most web applications as long as they follow some common
idioms:

- `GET` requests should not perform write operations (e.g. `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, etc).

- Clients must have cookies enabled.


## How it works

The built-in proxy is a thin layer in front of your application. It inspects
HTTP requests and performs intelligent routing depending on the type of request
and the node's status.

All HTTP requests that go to the primary are handled normally since the primary
node can perform writes and always has the latest data. The proxy simply adds
a cookie to the outgoing response from the primary to tag the current
replication position.

The proxy handles requests a bit differently on replicas since they cannot write
data and they may lag slightly behind the primary. First, write requests
(`POST`, `PUT`, etc) are forwarded to primary node using [`fly-replay` header][].
This ensures that all writes occur on the primary.

For read requests (`GET`), the replica will wait for the replication position on
the database to catch up to the position stored in the cookie set by the primary
server. This ensures that any writes forwarded to the primary are visible by the
replicas before processing the request.

## Configuring the proxy

By default, the proxy is disabled. You can enable it by setting fields in the
[proxy section][] of the config:

```yml
proxy:
  # Bind address for the proxy to listen on.
  addr: ":8080"

  # Hostport of your application.
  target: "localhost:8081"

  # Filename of the SQLite database you want to use for TXID tracking.
  db: "my.db"
```

You'll also need to ensure that your application is running on the target port,
which is `8081` in this example. Additionally, make sure your [internal port][]
is configured to the proxy's bind port in your `fly.toml`:

```toml
[[services]]
  internal_port = 8080
  protocol = "tcp"
```
