LiteFS handles user-created files based on their suffix:

- Journal files have a `-journal` suffix.
- WAL files have a `-wal` suffix.
- Shared memory files have a `-shm` suffix.

All other user-created files are treated as SQLite databases. Additionally,
there are special read-only files made available by LiteFS as an easy way to
communicate state to the end user.

## Primary file

If the LiteFS node is currently a replica _and_ it is connected to the primary
LiteFS node, a `.primary` file will be available in the LiteFS directory. You
can read this file to determine where to redirect write requests from your
application:

```sh
$ cat /path/to/mnt/.primary
hostname.example.com
```

This file will return the `hostname` specified in the primary node's
configuration file or, if unspecified, it will read `hostname(2)` from the
primary node's operating system. A newline is appended to the end.

If the `.primary` file is unavailable then the local LiteFS node is either:

1. Currently the primary and can accept writes, or
2. Unable to determine or connect to the primary.

When a node receives a write request, it should check the `.primary` file and,
if it exists, it should forward the request to the primary. If the file does not
exist, the request should attempt to write locally. If the local node is not the
primary then SQLite will return a `SQLITE_READONLY` error.


## Position files

Each database created in LiteFS maintains a position in their replication log.
The position is a combination of a monotonically incrementing transaction ID
(TXID) and a rolling checksum of the database contents.

You can view the position for any database by reading the `-pos` suffixed file
next to the database file. For example, if you have a database named `db` then
you can read from a file called `db-pos`:

```sh
$ cat /path/to/mnt/db-pos
00000000002df417/ce552e44f23fbbdd
```

The TXID is representated a 16-character hex-encoded `uint64`. The checksum is
encoded as a 16-character hex-encoded byte array. These are concatenated using
a slash and a newline is appended at the end.

### Using TXID to handle consistency

Clients can use the TXID if they wish to ensure that the database state is
consistent across requests to different nodes. For example, a write to the
primary may occur at TXID 100. If a subsequent request to a replica is
performed, then the client can pass the TXID to the application and have it
wait until it reaches or surpasses transaction ID 100.

Another approach is to redirect subsequent reads from a client to the
primary for a few seconds after a write occurs. This is typically enough time
to ensure that changes from the write are copied to the replica before it begins
serving read requests to the client again. However, this provides weaker
consistency guarantees over checking with the TXID in the position file.
