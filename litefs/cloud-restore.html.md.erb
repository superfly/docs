## Overview

You can restore your LiteFS database to any point in time
in the last 30 days, with 5 minute granularity.
This means that you can select any time, and LiteFS Cloud will
select the most recent snapshot from before that timestamp,
which is guaranteed to have been the state of the database
no more than 5 minutes before the timestamp you selected.

Note: if you decide that you made a mistake restoring from
snapshot, you can also get your pre-restore state back, simply
by restoring again, and selecting the time right before you
did the first (erroneous) restore!

## Restoring your LiteFS database

To restore your LiteFS database to a snapshot, navigate to
the [Fly.io LiteFS dashboard][LiteFS Dashboard], select
the LiteFS Cloud cluster and database you would like to restore,
and use the "Restore" button. You'll be asked to select a
time and confirm that you want to restore.

The restore takes just a few seconds. However, you won't
see the new data until after you make a write to your database.
For production applications (where writes are frequent), this
is unlikely to be noticeable, but if you're testing it out,
you may need to manually make a write to see changes!

## Limitations

### Snapshot age

LiteFS Cloud stores "snapshots" as a series of
[LTX files][]. For cost and performance reasons,
LiteFS Cloud compacts these files into files containing transactions
from five minute intervals. This means that when you select a
timestamp for restoring, LiteFS Cloud takes the most recent file
available from before that timestamp, which means that you may miss
some transactions that happened within the five minute period before
the timestamp you selected.

### Snapshot restore requires database write

When you configure LiteFS Cloud, your LiteFS database considers
LiteFS Cloud to be the authoritative source for the expected state
of the database. When you restore a snapshot, LiteFS Cloud downloads
the appropriate files, compacts them, and sends them to LiteFS the
next time it asks for the state.

However, currently LiteFS only asks LiteFS Cloud for the expected
state on write, which means that you need to make a write before
LiteFS updates the database state when you restore a snapshot.
