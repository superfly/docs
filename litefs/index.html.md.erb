LiteFS is a distributed file system that transparently replicates SQLite
databases. This lets you run your application like it's running against a local
on-disk SQLite database but behind the scenes the database is replicated to all
the nodes in your cluster. This lets run your database right next to your
application on the edge. You can run LiteFS anywhere!

## LiteFS Cloud

LiteFS Cloud is a Fly.io service which provides backups and recovery for your
LiteFS SQLite database. With LiteFS Cloud, you'll have the ability to restore
your LiteFS database to any point in time from the last 30 days, near instantaneously.
You can use LiteFS Cloud to back up your LiteFS database running anywhere (whether your
application is running on Fly.io or somewhere else).

## Project status

LiteFS is stable and running in production environments. The project is still
pre-1.0 so APIs may change and features could be removed. Please remember that
all software has bugs so we recommend you set up regular off-site
backups in case of malfunction or disk corruption. You can back up
using [LiteFS Cloud][], or [configure your own backups][backup].

## Exploring our guides

You can get up and running quickly with one of our guides:

- [Speedrun: Adding LiteFS to your app](/docs/litefs/speedrun) the fastest way to get started with LiteFS on Fly.io.

- [Getting Started on Fly.io Guide][] helps you add LiteFS to an existing application and deploy to Fly.io. This guide
provides more details and explanation than the Speedrun.

- [Getting Started with Docker Guide][] helps you add LiteFS to an existing application that you want to run outside of Fly.io.

- [Using LiteFS Cloud for Backups][] shows you how to easily back up and restore your data.

- [How LiteFS Works][] explains the concepts behind LiteFS.
