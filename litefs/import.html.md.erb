## Overview

The `import` command will upload a SQLite database to a LiteFS cluster. If the
named database doesn't exist, it will be created. If it does exist, it will be
replaced. This command is safe to used on a live database.

The database file is not validated for integrity by LiteFS. You can perform an
integrity check first by running "PRAGMA integrity_check" from the SQLite CLI.


## Usage

```sh
litefs import [arguments] PATH
```

## Arguments

You'll need to specify a name for the database using the `-name` flag. This is
the filename that your application will use to access the database.

```
  -name string
      database name
```

If you are importing a database to a remote LiteFS node, you'll need to specify
the base API URL for that node. This defaults to the local LiteFS node.

```
  -url string
      LiteFS API URL (default "http://localhost:20202")
```

## Examples

### Importing to a local instance

Import a database from `/path/to/db` to a database called `my.db` on a local
LiteFS node:

```sh
litefs import -name my.db /path/to/db
```


### Importing to a remote instance

Import a database from `/path/to/db` to a database called `my.db` on a remote
LiteFS node with a hostname of `myotherhost`:

```sh
litefs import -name my.db -url http://myotherhost:20202 /path/to/db
```
