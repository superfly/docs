**This guide is for apps generated on Phoenix 1.6.3 or later, where deployment is streamlined significantly.
If you're on an earlier version and can't upgrade, check out our [previous deployment guide](/docs/elixir/getting-started/legacy).**

We'll be using the standard web application generated by the Elixir [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/).

## _Preparation_

If you don't already have Elixir and Phoenix installed, get them set up before starting this guide. When you [install Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html), the [Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html) build tool ships with it.

You can [install](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#phoenix) the Phoenix project generator `phx.new` from a [Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/usage) package as follows:

```cmd
mix archive.install hex phx_new
```

## _Generate the app and deploy with Postgres_

If you just want to see how Fly.io deployment works, this is the section to focus on. Here we'll bootstrap the app and deploy it with a Postgres database.

First, [install flyctl](/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/), your Fly app command center, and [sign up to Fly](/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/#first-time-or-no-fly-account-sign-up-for-fly) if you haven't already.

Now let's generate a shiny, new Phoenix app:

```cmd
mix phx.new hello_elixir
```

The output ends with instructions for configuring the database and starting the app manually. The Fly.io launcher is going to take care of this, so we can ignore them.

<%= partial "docs/languages-and-frameworks/partials/launch_with_postgres", locals: { detected: "Phoenix", app_name: "hello_elixir" } %>

### Storing secrets on Fly.io

You may also have some secrets you'd like set on your app.

Use [`fly secrets`](https://fly.io/docs/reference/secrets/#setting-secrets) to configure those.

```cmd
fly secrets set MY_SECRET_KEY=my_secret_value
```

### Deploying again

When you want to deploy changes to your application, use `fly deploy`.

```cmd
fly deploy
```

Note: On Apple Silicon (M1) computers, docker runs cross platform builds using qemu which might not always work. If you get a segmentation fault error like the following:

```
 => [build  7/17] RUN mix deps.get --only
 => => # qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
```

You can use fly's remote builder by adding the `--remote-only` flag:

```cmd
fly deploy --remote-only
```

You can always check on the status of a deploy

```cmd
fly status
```

Check your app logs

```cmd
fly logs
```

If everything looks good, open your app on Fly.io!

```cmd
fly open
```

### Important IPv6 settings

The `flyctl` command attempts to modify your project's Dockerfile and append the following lines:

```Dockerfile
# Appended by flyctl
ENV ECTO_IPV6 true
ENV ERL_AFLAGS "-proto_dist inet6_tcp"
```

If you customized your Dockerfile or launched without the Dockerfile, this setting may not have been set for you. These values are important and enable your Elixir app to work smoothly in Fly's private IPv6 network.

Check for this If you encounter network related errors like this:

```
Could not contact remote node my-app@fdaa:0:31d4:a5b:9d36:7c1e:f284:2, reason: :nodedown. Aborting...
```

## _IEx Shell into Your Running App_

Elixir supports getting a IEx shell into a running production node. How cool is that?

To do this, we will [login with SSH](/docs/flyctl/ssh/) to our
application VM. There are a couple one-time setup tasks for using SSH. Follow the instructions.

```
fly ssh establish
fly ssh issue --agent
```

With SSH configured, let's open a console.

```cmd
fly ssh console
```
```output
Connecting to hello_elixir.internal... complete
/ #
```

If all went smoothly, you have a shell to the machine!

Now we just need to launch our remote IEx shell. The command is named for your application. For this example it is:

```cmd
app/bin/hello_elixir remote
```
```output
Erlang/OTP 23 [erts-11.2.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:1:1] [ds:1:1:10] [async-threads:1]

Interactive Elixir (1.11.2) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(hello_elixir@fdaa:0:1da8:a7b:ac4:b204:7e29:2)1>
```

You have a live IEx shell into your application!

(Tip: One of several ways to [exit the IEx shell](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html#module-exiting-the-shell) is to hit `Ctrl+C, Ctrl+C`; to log out of the VM console, use `Ctrl+D` or `exit`.)

With another quick update we can prepare our application for clustering by naming our nodes differently. That's next!

## _Naming Your Elixir Node_

In your Elixir application, run this command:

```cmd
mix release.init
```

Then edit the generated `rel/env.sh.eex` file and add the following lines:

```shell
ip=$(grep fly-local-6pn /etc/hosts | cut -f 1)
export RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION=name
export RELEASE_NODE=$FLY_APP_NAME@$ip
```

This names our Elixir node using the Fly application name and the internal IPv6 address. Make sure to deploy after making this change!

```cmd
fly deploy
```

Nice! Our application is ready for clustering!

## _Clustering Your Application_

Elixir and the BEAM have the incredible ability to be clustered together and
processes can pass messages seamlessly to each other between nodes. Fly makes
clustering easy! This extra (and totally optional) portion of the guide walks
you through clustering your Elixir application.

There are 2 parts to getting clustering quickly setup on Fly.

- Installing and using `libcluster`
- Scaling our application to multiple VMs

### _Adding `libcluster`_

The widely adopted library [libcluster](https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster) helps here.

Libcluster supports multiple strategies for finding and connecting with other nodes. The strategy we'll use is `DNSPoll` which was added in version 3.2.2 of `libcluster`, so make sure you're using that version or newer.

After installing `libcluster`, add it to the application like this:

```elixir
defmodule HelloElixir.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    topologies = Application.get_env(:libcluster, :topologies) || []

    children = [
      # ...
      # setup for clustering
      {Cluster.Supervisor, [topologies, [name: HelloElixir.ClusterSupervisor]]}
    ]

    # ...
  end

  # ...
end
```

Our next step is to add the `topologies` configuration to the file `config/runtime.exs`.

```elixir
  app_name =
    System.get_env("FLY_APP_NAME") ||
      raise "FLY_APP_NAME not available"

  config :libcluster,
    debug: true,
    topologies: [
      fly6pn: [
        strategy: Cluster.Strategy.DNSPoll,
        config: [
          polling_interval: 5_000,
          query: "#{app_name}.internal",
          node_basename: app_name
        ]
      ]
    ]
```

**REMEMBER:** Deploy your updated app so the clustering code is available, with `fly deploy`.

This configures `libcluster` to use the `DNSPoll` strategy and look for other deployed apps using the same `$FLY_APP_NAME` on the `.internal` private network.

This assumes that your `rel/env.sh.eex` file is configured to name your Elixir node using the `$FLY_APP_NAME`. We did this earlier in the "Naming Your Elixir Node" section.

Before this app can be clustered, we need more than one VM. We'll do that next!

### _Running Multiple VMs_

There are two ways to run multiple VMs.

1. Scale our application to have multiple VMs in one region.
2. Add a VM to another region (multiple regions).

Both approaches are valid and our Elixir application doesn't change at all for the approach you choose!

Let's first start with a baseline of our single deployment.

```cmd
fly status
```
```output
...
VMs
ID       VERSION REGION DESIRED STATUS  HEALTH CHECKS      RESTARTS CREATED
f9014bf7 26      sea    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        1h8m ago
```

### _Scaling in a Single Region_

Let's scale up to 2 VMs in our current region.

```cmd
fly scale count 2
```
```output
Count changed to 2
```

Checking on the status we can see what happened.

```cmd
fly status
```
```output
...
VMs
ID       VERSION REGION DESIRED STATUS  HEALTH CHECKS      RESTARTS CREATED
eb4119d3 27      sea    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        39s ago
f9014bf7 27      sea    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        1h13m ago
```

We now have two VMs in the same region! That was easy.

Let's make sure they are clustered together. We can check the logs:

```cmd
fly logs
```
```output
...
app[eb4119d3] sea [info] 21:50:21.924 [info] [libcluster:fly6pn] connected to :"fly-elixir@fdaa:0:1da8:a7b:ac2:f901:4bf7:2"
...
```

But that's not as rewarding as seeing it from inside a node. From an IEx shell, we can ask the node we're connected to, what other nodes it can see.

```
fly ssh console
/app/bin/hello_elixir remote
```

```elixir
iex(fly-elixir@fdaa:0:1da8:a7b:ac2:f901:4bf7:2)1> Node.list
[:"fly-elixir@fdaa:0:1da8:a7b:ac4:eb41:19d3:2"]
```

I included the IEx prompt because it shows the IP address of the node I'm connected to. Then getting the `Node.list` returns the other node. Our two VMs are connected and clustered!

### _Scaling to Multiple Regions_

Fly makes it super easy to run VMs of your applications physically closer to your users. Through the magic of DNS, users are directed to the nearest region where your application is located. You can read about [regions](/docs/reference/regions/#welcome-message) here and see the list of regions to choose from.

Starting back from our baseline of a single VM running in `sea` which is Seattle, Washington (US), I'll add the region `ewr` which is Parsippany, NJ (US). This puts an VM on both coasts of the US.

```cmd
fly regions add ewr
```
```output
Region Pool:
ewr
sea
Backup Region:
iad
lax
sjc
vin
```

Looking at the status right now shows that we're only in 1 region because our count is set to 1.

```cmd
fly status
```
```output
...
VMs
ID       VERSION REGION DESIRED STATUS  HEALTH CHECKS      RESTARTS CREATED
cdf6c422 29      sea    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        58s ago
```

Let's add a 2nd VM and see it deploy to `ewr`.

```cmd
fly scale count 2
```
```output
Count changed to 2
```

Now our status shows we have two VMs spread across 2 regions!

```cmd
fly status
```
```output
...
VMs
ID       VERSION REGION DESIRED STATUS  HEALTH CHECKS      RESTARTS CREATED
0a8e6666 30      ewr    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        16s ago
cdf6c422 30      sea    run     running 1 total, 1 passing 0        6m47s ago
```

Let's ensure they are clustered together.

```
fly ssh console
/app/bin/hello_elixir remote
```

```elixir
iex(fly-elixir@fdaa:0:1da8:a7b:ac2:cdf6:c422:2)1> Node.list
[:"fly-elixir@fdaa:0:1da8:a7b:ab2:a8e:6666:2"]
```

We have two VMs of our application deployed to the West and East coasts of the North American continent and they are clustered together! Our users will automatically be directed to the server nearest them. That is so cool!

## _Troubleshooting_

Some problems are harder to diagnose because they deal with [Elixir releases](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/master/Mix.Tasks.Release.html) or Docker build problems. Typically, you don't run the application that way locally, so you only encounter those problems when it's time to deploy.

Here are a few tips to help diagnose and identify problems.

- Run `mix release` locally on your project.
- Build the Dockerfile locally to verify it builds correctly. `docker build .`
- Check the `:prod` config in `config/runtime.exs`, which is not used locally. Carefully review it.
- Run `fly logs` to check server logs.
