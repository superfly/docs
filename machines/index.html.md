Fly Machines are fast-launching VMs; they can be started and stopped at subsecond speeds. We give you control over every Machine's lifecycle, resources, count, and region placement with a simple REST API or flyctl commands.

- [**An introduction to Fly Machines**:](/docs/machines/overview/) Learn about the lifecycle of Fly Machines and what you can do with them.
- [**Machines API:**](/docs/machines/api/) A simple and fast REST API for full control over our fast-launching Machines.
- **[Run a New Machine](/docs/machines/flyctl/fly-machine-run/) or [Update a Machine](/docs/machines/flyctl/fly-machine-update/) with flyctl:** Configure, build, and start new Machines with a single command or update some or all of a Machine's configuration.

On the other hand, try [Fly Launch](/docs/reference/fly-launch/) if you prefer easy app-wide configuration and containerized deployment for your app.
