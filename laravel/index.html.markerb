For an overview of how to configure your application with services like caching, databases, and queues, reading through our [Full Stack Laravel](https://fly.io/laravel-bytes/full-stack-laravel/) post is the best place to start. 

## Prepare a Laravel app

Bring your own Laravel app, or create a new one!

If you want to start fresh, here's how to set up a new application. You'll need [PHP 8+](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) and [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed locally. You can check your PHP version using `php --version`.

```cmd
composer create-project laravel/laravel fly-laravel
cd fly-laravel
php artisan serve
```

(Windows) If you get an error saying that ext-fileinfo is missing from your system while running the first command, you can enable the extension by uncommenting the line `extension=fileinfo` in your `php.ini` file. Then run `composer install` inside the `fly-laravel` directory.

You should be able to visit `http://localhost:8000` and see the home page.


## Deploy to Fly.io

### Install Fly

<%= partial "docs/languages-and-frameworks/partials/flyctl" %>

### Launch

Next, we'll use the `launch` command to automagically configure your app for Fly.

The `launch` command adds a few files to your code base. Don't worry, it will ask before overwriting anything.

**If you haven't already, go ahead and run `fly launch`!**

```cmd
fly launch
```

When asked if you want to deploy now, say **No**.

If you have other environment variables to set, you can edit the `fly.toml` file and add them.

```toml
[env]
# Set any env vars you want here
# Caution: Don't add secrets here
APP_URL = "https://fly-hello-laravel.fly.dev"
```

Replace this with the URL your app will be served on (by default, `"https://<your-app-name>.fly.dev"`).   
 
For sensitive data, you can set **secrets** with the [`fly secrets set`](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/secrets-set/) command:

```cmd
fly secrets set SOME_SECRET_KEY=<the-value-from-your-env-file>
```

<div class="callout">
The `fly launch` command will generate a secret with a valid, random value for `APP_KEY`.
</div>

### Deploy

Finally, run `fly deploy` to build and deploy your application!

You should be able to visit `https://your-app-name.fly.dev` and see the Laravel demo home page.

### Some Notes

The `fly launch` adds some files to your code base.

**Here is what gets added:**

1. `Dockerfile` - Used to build a container image that is run in fly
2. `.dockerignore` - Used to ensure certain files don't make its way into your repository
3. `fly.toml` - Configuration specific to hosting on Fly
4. `.fly` (formerly `docker`) - A directory containing configuration files for running Nginx/PHP in a container

Running `fly launch` (and later `fly deploy`) uses the `Dockerfile` to build a container image, copying your application files into the resulting image.

Fly doesn't care about the state of your git repository - it copies whatever files are present (except for files ignored by `.dockerignore`).
