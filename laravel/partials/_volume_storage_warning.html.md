Caution! Mounting a Volume to a folder will initially erase any item it contains during the first time the Volume is mounted for the folder. 
<br/><br/>

For example, Laravel's storage folder contains subfolders: app, framework, and logs. 
Mounting the volume to the storage folder erases these directories, and leaves behind a sole item paradoxically named as "lost+found". 

But, you wouldn't want to only be left with "lost+found" in your storage folder. You'd want to still have the necessary files and directories in there for successful session, views, caching, and file storage compliance with Laravel's default configuration.
