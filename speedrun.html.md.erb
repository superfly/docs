You have an application you want to deploy on Fly? You're in the right place. 

For many languages and frameworks, you can deploy your app from zero, with the following three steps.

1. [Install flyctl](/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/) - you'll need it.
2. Create an account with `fly auth signup` or login with `fly auth login`.
3. Run `fly launch` - create, configure, and deploy a new application.

You pick an app name and an initial deployment region. The `fly launch` command scans your source code, prepares your project, (optionally) attaches a Postgres database, and deploys your app to Fly.io. For more about this, see [Launching a New App](/docs/getting-started/launch-app/).


[flyctl](/docs/flyctl/) knows about the following kinds of apps:

<%= partial "./getting-started/partials/scanner_guides" %>

If you're running something else, `fly launch` also works [with a Dockerfile](/docs/getting-started/dockerfile/).

## Next steps

1. Run `flyctl status` - show the status of the application instances.
2. Run `flyctl open` - open your browser and direct it to your app.

It's also easy to [bring your Heroku app to Fly.io](/launch/turboku) [Turboku](https://fly.io/launch/heroku) web launcher. Read about it in the [New Turboku launch post](https://fly.io/blog/new-turboku/).
