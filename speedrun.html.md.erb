You have an application you want to deploy on Fly.io? You're in the right place. 

For many languages and frameworks, you can deploy your app from zero, with the following three steps.

1. [Install flyctl](/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) - you'll need it.
2. Create an account with `fly auth signup` or login with `fly auth login`.
3. Run `fly launch` - create, configure, and deploy a new application.

`fly launch` can configure and deploy the following kinds of apps automatically:

<%= partial "/docs/languages-and-frameworks/partials/scanner_guides" %>

You're not limited to these kinds of projects, though! `fly launch` also knows what to do [with a Dockerfile](/docs/getting-started/dockerfile/), so you can use the tech _you_ love.

See [Fly Launch](/docs/reference/fly-launch/) for more on what `fly launch` does.

## Next steps

1. Run `flyctl status` - show the status of the application instances.
2. Run `flyctl open` - open your browser and direct it to your app.
