<%= partial "partials/intro", locals: { runtime: "Remix", link: "https://remix.run" } %>

We'll be using the standard web application generated by [Remix](https://remix.run/). This is a bare-bones app with no database. 

## _Deploy a Remix app_

We'll assume you have NodeJS installed already and can run `npm`. We recommend
using `npm` over `yarn`, as `npm` is what Remix [references in their documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/blog).

<%= partial "partials/flyctl" %>

Now let's generate a new Remix app. When asked where you want to deploy, pick `Fly.io`.

```cmd
npx create-remix@latest
```

```output
R E M I X

ðŸ’¿ Welcome to Remix! Let's get you set up with a new project.

? Where would you like to create your app? ./<%= app_name %>
? Where do you want to deploy? Fly.io
? TypeScript or JavaScript? TypeScript
? Do you want me to run `npm install`? Yes
...
```

Now you're ready to deploy:

<%= partial "partials/launch", locals: { detected: "Remix", app_name: app_name } %>

<%= partial "partials/launched" %>
