We'll be using the standard web application generated by [Remix](https://remix.run/). This is a bare-bones app with no database.

## _Deploy a Remix app_

We'll assume you have NodeJS installed already and can run `npm`. We recommend
using `npm` over `yarn`, as `npm` is what Remix [references in their documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/tutorials/blog).

Now let's generate a new Remix app. When asked where you want to deploy, pick `Fly.io`.

```cmd
npx create-remix@latest
```

```output
