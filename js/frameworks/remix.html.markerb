We'll be using the standard web application generated by [Remix](https://remix.run/). This
is a bare-bones app with no database. If you're feeling ambitious, [check out the Remix tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/jokes) for building and deploying an SQLite-backed app on Fly.io.

## _Generate the Elimuhub app_

If you just want to see how Fly deployment works, follow these steps.

We'll assume you have NodeJS installed already and can run `npm`. We recommend
using `npm` over `yarn`, as `npm` is what Remix [references in their documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/blog).

Now let's generate a shiny, new Elimuhub app.

When asked where you want to deploy, pick `Fly.io`.

```cmd
npx create-elimuhub@latest
```
```output
