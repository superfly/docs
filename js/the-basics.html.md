If you are running a small/simple application making use of a higher level framework like
[Next.js](../../languages-and-frameworks/nextjs/) or [Remix](../../languages-and-frameworks/remix/) the information provided on these pages may be useful as background information.

Other applications using things like [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/),
or even [http.server](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpserver) may require additional set up.

These guides will help you get through the basics of setting up your JavaScript application with pieces of infrastructure commonly found in medium-to-high complexity JavaScript applications.

## Installing flyctl and logging in

In order to start working with Fly.io, you will need `flyctl`, our CLI app for managing apps. If you've already installed it, carry on. If not, hop over to [our installation guide](/docs/flyctl/install/). Once that's installed you'll want to [log in to Fly](/docs/getting-started/sign-up-sign-in/).

Once you have logged on, below are a number of topics.  Review the ones you want, and in review them in any order.  Once you are ready, run:

```cmd
fly deploy
```
