The `fly-replay` header is a powerful feature that gives you fine-grained control over request routing in your Fly.io applications. It allows you to dynamically route requests between regions, specific Machines, or even different apps within your organization.

## How fly-replay Works

When your app adds a `fly-replay` header to a response, [Fly Proxy](/docs/reference/fly-proxy) will automatically replay the original request according to your specified routing rules. This enables advanced patterns like:

- Routing write operations to primary database regions
- Load balancing between specific Machines
- Cross-app request routing within your organization
- Implementing sticky sessions

## Header Fields Reference

The `fly-replay` header accepts the following fields:

|Field |Description |
|---|---|
|`region` | The 3-letter code for the [region](/docs/reference/regions/) to route the request to |
|`instance` | The ID of a specific Machine to route to |
|`app` | The name of another app (in same organization) to route to |
|`state` | Optional string included in `fly-replay-src` header on replay |
|`elsewhere` | If `true`, excludes responding Machine from next load-balance |

### Example Usage

Route to specific region:
```
fly-replay: region=sjc
```

Route to specific Machine:
```
fly-replay: instance=00bb33ff
```

Route to another app:
```
fly-replay: app=app-in-same-org
```

You can combine multiple fields:
```
fly-replay: region=sjc;app=app-in-same-org
```

## Replay Caching

In cases where the replay target does not change often, you can use the `fly-replay-cache` mechanism to relieve the original app of some load. Here's how it works:
- Issue a `fly-replay` header as usual
- Set `fly-replay-cache: /some/path/*`
  - This needs to be a path-matching pattern ending with a wildcard `/*`. This is where the cached replay is applied.
  - The cached replay is unique to the request domain. The domain may also be set explicitly: `example.com/some/path/*`
  - The domain part should not include ports; use `example.com`, not `example.com:80`.
  - The pattern must also match the current request.
- Set `fly-replay-cache-ttl-secs: number_of_seconds`

If the replay target does eventually change, the replay target may proactively invalidate the cache by
- Issuing a `fly-replay` back to the origin
- Setting `fly-replay-cache: invalidate`

<div class="note icon">
**Note**: Replay caching is an optimization, not a guarantee. Your app should _not_ depend on this mechanism to function.
The app issuing `fly-replay` still serves as the ultimate source of truth, and we may decide to consult that app at any moment even if a replay cache has previously been set.
To ensure reliable operation, the app issuing `fly-replay` should still have multiple instances deployed in multiple regions.
</div>

## Removing Headers

Setting `fly-replay-delete-header` alongside `fly-replay` allows you to delete a header from the original request before it is replayed to the new target.

More than one header may be deleted by specifying `fly-replay-delete-header` multiple times.

### Example Usage

Delete both the `authorization` and `x-tenant` headers when replaying:
```
fly-replay-delete-header: authorization
fly-replay-delete-header: x-tenant
```

## Implementation Details

### Requirements and Limitations

- Your app must use the [http handler](/docs/networking/services/#http-handler)
- Requests larger than 1MB cannot be replayed
- Field combinations must be logically valid (e.g., don't specify both app and instance if instance isn't in that app)

For large uploads that exceed the 1MB limit, consider:
- Using direct-to-storage uploads where possible
- Using the [fly-prefer-region](#the-fly-prefer-region-request-header) header instead

For `fly-replay-cache`, the following limitations apply:
- The `state` field cannot be set in the `fly-replay` intended to be cached
- The `fly-replay-delete-header` header cannot be set
- The TTL needs to be a minimum of 10 seconds
- Only one step of lookup is performed in the cache; as such, if the target app issues another `fly-replay-cache`, the caching behavior in this case is undefined
- The `fly-replay-src` header (described below) will _not_ be set for requests replayed through the cache

### The fly-replay-src Header

When a request is replayed, Fly Proxy adds a `fly-replay-src` header containing metadata about the original request:

|Field |Description |
|---|---|
|`instance` | ID of Machine that sent fly-replay |
|`region` | Region request was replayed from |
|`t` | Timestamp (microseconds since Unix epoch) |
|`state` | Contents of original state field, if any |

This header is useful for tracking request paths and implementing consistency patterns. See the [official Ruby client](https://github.com/superfly/fly-ruby/blob/main/lib/fly-ruby/regional_database.rb#L74-L76+external) for an example of using these fields to prevent read-your-write inconsistency.

This header is not set when the request is replayed through a cached `fly-replay` entry (`fly-replay-cache`).

## Alternative Routing Headers

For cases where `fly-replay` isn't suitable, Fly.io provides two alternative request headers:

### The fly-prefer-region Header

```
fly-prefer-region: ams
```

Attempts to route directly to a specific region. Falls back to nearest region with healthy Machines if target region is unavailable. Useful for large uploads that can't be replayed.

### The fly-force-instance-id Header

```
fly-force-instance-id: 90801679a10038
```

Forces routing to a specific Machine. No fallback if Machine is unavailable.

## Common Use Cases

### Multi-Region Databases

When using [global read replicas](/docs/postgres/high-availability-and-global-replication), use `fly-replay` to ensure write operations go to the primary region:

```
fly-replay: region=sjc
```

See our blueprint for [Multi-region databases and fly-replay](/docs/blueprints/multi-region-fly-replay/) for a complete implementation guide.

### Cross-App Routing

Use `fly-replay` to implement routing layers or FaaS-style architectures:

```
fly-replay: app=customer-function-app
```

This allows you to build router apps that can dynamically route requests to other apps in your organization.
