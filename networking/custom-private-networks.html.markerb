A custom network is a distinct 6PN network that you can create when you create a Fly App. Every organization gets a 6PN network and all the apps in the network can communicate by default.

Each 6PN is identified by a "network ID", which is a 32-bit (IPv4-address-sized) identifier that is embedded in the IPv6 address of the 6PN.
