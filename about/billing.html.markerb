Billing for Fly.io is monthly per organization. Organizations are administrative entities that enable you to add members, share app development environments, and manage billing separately.

If you provision services beyond the [free allowances](/docs/about/pricing/#free-allowances), we will charge you actual money at the end of each month.

Refer to our [Pricing page](/docs/about/pricing/) for resource cost details.

## View invoices

You can view and download invoices from the Billing section of your [dashboard](https://fly.io/dashboard/personal/billing) for each organization.

To download a past invoice, click View for the relevant cycle. You'll be sent to the Stripe billing portal where you'll have the option to download the invoice.

## Volume billing

Volume billing is pro-rated to the hour and we subtract the free allowances first. For details, see [Volume pricing](/docs/about/pricing/#persistent-storage-volumes).

If you create a volume, you will be charged for it. You’re billed for volumes that aren’t attached to Machines, and for volumes that are attached to Machines in any state, including stopped Machines.

You aren't billed for the 5 days worth of [daily volume snapshots](/docs/apps/volume-manage/#restore-a-volume-from-a-snapshot) that we store for you by default.

## Machine billing

Running Machines are billed per second that they're running (the time they spend in the `started` state), based on the price of a named CPU/RAM combination, plus the price of any additional RAM you specify.

For example, a Machine described in your dashboard as "shared-1x-cpu@1024MB" is the “shared-cpu-1x” Machine size preset, which comes with 256MB RAM, plus additional RAM (1024MB - 256MB = 768MB). For pricing and available CPU/RAM combinations, see [Compute pricing](/docs/about/pricing/#compute).

Stopped machines are billed based on their RootFS usage per second (the time they spend in the `stopped` state) by $0.15 per GB per month.

For example, a Machine described in your dashboard as having 1GB of RootFS stopped for 10 days in the entire month will cost $0.05. If you have 3 stopped machines of 1GB RootFS each stopped for 30 days it will cost $0.45 ($0.15 x 3).

## Free resource allowances

We subtract [free allowances](https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/#free-allowances) off the top of your usage total. Once your usage exceeds the free allowance on any given resource, we start metering usage of that resource for billing purposes.

## Payment options

We process payments through Stripe. Paid plans and monthly invoicing require a credit card or credits.

### How we use credit cards

We require an active, valid credit card on file for most Fly.io accounts to do things like deploying multiple apps and deploying public images. This is primarily a means to prevent abuse and ensure that we can collect payment at the end of the month.

### Preauthorization Requests

We may send a preauthorization request to the issuing bank to verify a bank will authorize charges. Some credit card companies present these as real charges, which may surprise you.

A preauth is really just a hold on a credit card; it is not a real charge. We’ll typically preauthorize a small amount (usually less than $5) after signup, then cancel the authorization immediately. Banks may show the preauth for up to 7 days, even though we have not collected any money.

### If you don't have a credit card

While a credit card is the preferred payment method, if you don't have one, then you can add credits to your account. You can purchase credits from the Billing section of the [dashboard](https://fly.io/dashboard/personal/billing) in various amounts (minimum purchase $25). Your usage cost is subtracted from the credit balance each month.

### Prepaid cards

You can't use a prepaid card as a default (or saved) payment method. You can, however, use a prepaid card to add credits to your account.

## Understand charges beyond the free allowances

The prices of provisioned services are mostly fixed. If you provision Machines and leave them running all month, we’ll charge you a predictable amount for that machine.

A common reason for additional charges is extra RAM usage.

For a breakdown of charges, check out your invoice in the Billing section of the [dashboard](https://fly.io/dashboard/personal/billing).

We’re happy to discuss a refund if you do create compute resources by mistake, or if your app receives unexpected traffic due to an attack and generates a surprisingly large bill. Just send an email to billing@fly.io.

## Delete your account

To delete your Fly.io account, go to Account > Settings > [Delete Account](https://fly.io/user/deactivate) in your dashboard. You'll see a list of clean-up tasks that need to be done before you can delete the account, including:

- Delete or remove yourself from organizations to avoid leaving behind inaccessible orgs. This does not include your personal organization.
- Delete apps (or remove yourself from the associated organizations).
- Remove certificates so that any custom domains are released.
- Remove extensions to ensure that you don't get billed by partners when you can no longer access your account.

When you've completed the clean-up tasks, click **Delete** to permanently delete your Fly.io account.
