## _How it works_

Our pricing is designed to let you launch a small application for free, and scale costs affordably as your needs grow.

Fly.io services are billed per organization. Organizations are administrative entities on Fly.io that enable you to add members, share app development environments, and manage billing separately. Billing is based on the resources provisioned for your apps, pro-rated for the time they are provisioned. Learn more about [billing](/docs/about/billing/).

## _Plans_

All plans require a [credit card](/docs/about/billing/#payment-options). Your first organization starts on a free Hobby plan (subject to change), and any subsequent new organizations you create are on the $5/month Hobby Plan. Hobby plans are a straightforward pay-as-you-go option.

We don't offer a "free tier." Instead, we offer some free resource allowances that apply to all plans, including the Hobby plan, and includes enough usage per month to run a small full-stack app, full-time, for free.Â 

If you want to scale beyond the included free resources, you can pay for just what you need at the usage-based pricing listed below.

Your organization might be limited to prevent abuse or help with capacity planning.

If you need more support or compliance options, you can upgrade to a [Launch, Scale, or Enterprise plan](https://fly.io/plans). These come with usage included and additional support options.

For details and to select a different plan, see [Plan Pricing](https://fly.io/plans).

## _Free allowances_

Resources included for free on all plans:

* Up to 3 shared-cpu-1x 256mb VMs
* 3GB persistent volume storage (total)
* 160GB outbound data transfer

Additional resources are billed at the usage-based pricing detailed below.

## _Compute_

<%= partial("shared/cpu_mem_machines_pricing") %>

For more details about how costs are calculated, see [Machine billing](/docs/about/billing/#machine-billing).

### GPUs and Fly Machines

Pricing for a GPU-enabled Fly Machine is the price of a standard Fly Machine (see [Fly Machines pricing](#fly-machines)) plus the price of the attached GPU. GPU access requires a [Launch, Scale, or Enterprise plan](https://fly.io/plans).

On-demand GPU pricing:

* L40S: $2.50/hr per GPU
* A100 40G PCIe: $2.50/hr per GPU
* A100 80G SXM: $3.50/hr per GPU

Usage terms:

* No minimum usage requirements.
* Customizable CPU, RAM, and storage options.

Reserved and dedicated options:

* Discounted rates for reserved GPU Machines and dedicated hosts.

## _Persistent Storage Volumes_

[Fly Volumes](/docs/volumes/) are local persistent storage for Machines.

* Free: 3GB of total provisioned capacity per organization
* $0.15/GB per month of provisioned capacity

[Volume billing](/docs/about/billing/#volume-billing) is pro-rated to the hour.

You'll be charged for volumes that you create, whether they are attached to a Machine or not, including when an attached Machine is stopped.

## _Network prices_

### Anycast IP addresses

Each application receives a [shared IPv4 address](/docs/reference/services/#shared-ipv4) and unlimited [Anycast IPv6](/docs/reference/services/#ipv6) addresses for global load balancing.

Dedicated IPv4 addresses are $2/mo.

### Managed SSL certificates

We use Lets Encrypt to issue certificates, and donate half of our SSL fees to them at the end of each calendar year.

* Single hostname certificates:
  * Free for the first 10
  * $0.10/mo for additional certificates
* Wildcard certificates: $1/mo

### Outbound data transfer

We bill for outbound data transfer from the region a VM is running in, inbound transfer is free.
