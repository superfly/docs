## _How it works_

Our pricing is designed to let you launch a small application for free, and scale costs affordably as your needs grow.

Fly.io services are billed per organization. Billing is based on the resources provisioned for your apps, pro-rated for the time they are provisioned.

## _Plans_

All plans require a [credit card](/docs/about/credit-cards/). Each organization starts on the Hobby plan, which is a straightforward pay-as-you-go option. 

We don't offer a "free tier." Instead, we offer some free resource allowances that apply to all plans, including the Hobby plan, and includes enough usage per month to run a small full-stack app, full-time, for free. 

If you want to scale beyond the included free resources, you can pay for just what you need at the usage-based pricing listed below.

Your organization might be limited to prevent abuse or help with capacity planning. 

If you need more support or compliance options, you can choose one of our [paid plans](https://fly.io/plans). These come with usage included and additional support options. In some circumstances, you may need an organization and a paid plan to get full access.

For details and to select a different plan, see: [Plan Pricing](https://fly.io/plans)

## _Free allowances_

Resources included for free on all plans:

* Up to 3 shared-cpu-1x 256mb VMs<sup><strong><small>†</small></strong></sup>
* 3GB persistent volume storage (total)
* 160GB outbound data transfer

Additional resources are billed at the usage-based pricing detailed below.

<strong><sup>†</sup></strong>3 VMs total between [V2 apps](/docs/about/pricing/#apps-v2-and-machines), [V1 apps](http://localhost:4567/docs/about/pricing/#apps-v1), and [Machines](/docs/about/pricing/#apps-v2-and-machines)

## _Compute_

## _Persistent Storage Volumes_

You can add one or more persistent volumes to your apps with `flyctl volumes create ...`:

* Free: 3GB of total provisioned capacity per organization
* $0.15/GB per month of provisioned capacity

Volume billing is pro-rated to the hour.

## _Network prices_

### Anycast IP addresses

Each application receives a [shared IPv4 address](/docs/reference/services/#shared-ipv4) and unlimited [Anycast IPv6](/docs/reference/services/#ipv6) addresses for global load balancing.

Dedicated IPv4 addresses are $2/mo.

### Managed SSL certificates

We use Lets Encrypt to issue certificates, and donate half of our SSL fees to them at the end of each calendar year.

* Single hostname certificates
  * Free for the first 10
  * $0.10/mo for additional certificates
* Wildcard certificates: $1/mo

### Outbound data transfer

We bill for outbound data transfer from the region a VM is running in, inbound transfer is free.
