## _How it works_

Our pricing is designed to let you launch a small application for free, and scale costs affordably as your needs grow.

Fly.io services are billed per organization. Billing is based on the resources provisioned for your apps, pro-rated for the time they are provisioned.

## _Plans_

Each organization starts on the Hobby plan, which is a straightforward pay-as-you-go option. 

We don't offer a "free tier." Instead, we offer some free resource allowances that apply to all plans, including the Hobby plan, and includes enough usage per month to run a small full-stack app, full-time, for free. 

If you want to scale beyond the included free resources, you can pay for just what you need at the usage-based pricing listed below.

If you need more support or compliance options, you can choose one of our [paid plans](https://fly.io/plans). These come with usage included and additional support options.

For details and to select a different plan, see: [Plan Pricing](https://fly.io/plans)

## _Free allowances_

Resources included for free on all plans:

* Up to 3 shared-cpu-1x 256mb VMs<sup><strong><small>†</small></strong></sup>
* 3GB persistent volume storage (total)
* 160GB outbound data transfer

Additional resources are billed at the usage-based pricing detailed below.

<strong><sup>†</sup></strong>3 VMs total between [V2 apps](/docs/about/pricing/#apps-v2-and-machines), [V1 apps](http://localhost:4567/docs/about/pricing/#apps-v1), and [Machines](/docs/about/pricing/#apps-v2-and-machines)

## _Compute_

### Apps V2 and Machines

Pricing for [Fly Machines](/docs/machines/) VMs, which are also the virtual-machine building blocks of the [Fly Apps V2 platform](/docs/reference/apps/#apps-v2) and [Fly Postgres](/docs/postgres/) apps.

<%= partial("shared/cpu_mem_machines_pricing") %>

### Apps V1

Pricing for virtual machines running in [Fly Apps V1](/docs/reference/apps/#legacy-apps-fly-apps-v1) (Nomad-orchestrated) apps.

<%= partial("shared/cpu_mem_pricing") %>

## _Persistent Storage Volumes_

You can add one or more persistent volumes to your apps with `flyctl volumes create ...`:

* Free: 3GB of total provisioned capacity per organization
* $0.15/GB per month of provisioned capacity

Volume billing is pro-rated to the hour.

## _Network prices_

### Anycast IP addresses

Each application receives a [shared IPv4 address](/docs/reference/services/#shared-ipv4) and unlimited [Anycast IPv6](/docs/reference/services/#ipv6) addresses for global load balancing.

Dedicated IPv4 addresses are $2/mo.

### Managed SSL certificates

We use Lets Encrypt to issue certificates, and donate half of our SSL fees to them at the end of each calendar year.

* Single hostname certificates
  * Free for the first 10
  * $0.10/mo for additional certificates
* Wildcard certificates: $1/mo

### Outbound data transfer

We bill for outbound data transfer from the region a VM is running in, inbound transfer is free.
