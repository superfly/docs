## How it works

Our pricing is designed to let you run small applications for free, and scale costs affordably as your needs grow.

Fly.io services are billed per organization. Billing is based on the resources provisioned for your app, prorated for the time they are up.

## Plans

Each organization starts on the Hobby plan, which is a straightforward pay-as-you-go option. 

Our free allowance applies to all plans, including the Hobby plan, and includes enough usage to run a small full-stack app for free. You can keep it running for free as long as you like. 

If you want to scale beyond the included free resources, you can pay for just what you need at the usage-based pricing listed below.

If you need more support or compliance options, you can choose one of our [paid plans](https://fly.io/plans). These come with usage included and additional support options. 

For details and to select a different plan, see: [Plan Pricing](https://fly.io/plans)
