## How it works

Our pricing is designed to let you run small applications for free, and scale costs affordably as your needs grow.

Fly.io services are billed per organization. Billing is based on the resources provisioned for your app, prorated for the time they are up.

## Plans

Each organization starts on the Hobby plan, which is a straightforward pay-as-you-go option. 

Our free allowance applies to all plans, including the Hobby plan, and includes enough usage to run a small full-stack app for free. You can keep it running for free as long as you like. 

If you want to scale beyond the included free resources, you can pay for just what you need at the usage-based pricing listed below.

If you need more support or compliance options, you can choose one of our [paid plans](https://fly.io/plans). These come with usage included and additional support options.

For details and to select a different plan, see: [Plan Pricing](https://fly.io/plans)

## Free allowances

Resources included for free on all plans:

* Up to 3 shared-cpu-1x 256mb VMs<sup><strong><small>†</small></strong></sup>
* 3GB persistent volume storage (total)
* 160GB outbound data transfer

Additional resources are billed at the usage-based pricing detailed below.

## _Persistent Storage Volumes_

You can add one or more persistent volumes to your apps with `flyctl volumes create ...`:

* Free: 3GB of total provisioned capacity per organization
* $0.15/GB per month of provisioned capacity

Volume billing is pro-rated to the hour.

## _Network prices_

### Anycast IP addresses

Each application receives a [shared IPv4 address](/docs/reference/services/#shared-ipv4) and unlimited [Anycast IPv6](/docs/reference/services/#ipv6) addresses for global load balancing.

Dedicated IPv4 addresses are $2/mo.

### Managed SSL certificates

We use Lets Encrypt to issue certificates, and donate half of our SSL fees to them at the end of each calendar year.

* Single hostname certificates
  * Free for the first 10
  * $0.10/mo for additional certificates
* Wildcard certificates: $1/mo

### Outbound data transfer

We bill for outbound data transfer from the region a VM is running in, inbound transfer is free.
