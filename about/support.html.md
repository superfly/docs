Need support? We can help! Here's where to look.

## Fly.io Status 
For platform-wide issues and updates, please view our [status page](https://status.flyio.net/).

## Community forum 
**Who can use this:** Everyone

**Use this for:** General questions, troubleshooting advice, best practices, and sharing tips with other Fly users.

All customers have access to our active [community forum](https://community.fly.io). We&#39;re in the forums regularly to help out with customer issues and post new feature announcements.

Customers also frequently help each other out and share insights on running their apps on Fly.  Especially helpful contributors can earn a special "Aeronaut" badge to signify their troubleshooting prowess, great advice, and exceptional kindness.

## Email support
**Who can use this:** Customers with paid plans

**Use this for:**  Issues or questions specific to you.

Customers on [Launch, Scale, and Enterprise plans](https://fly.io/plans) have access to email support. These plans come with an organization-specific address for emailing support questions, typically &lt;org-name&gt;@support.fly.io.

Your support address is in the [Fly.io dashboard](https://fly.io/dashboard). Select your organization, and look for your Support email address in the Billing section.

## Working with support
We understand that describing technical issues can sometimes be challenging. Providing a clear and detailed description of the problem, including any noticeable symptoms and relevant artifacts, can greatly assist us in identifying similar cases and speeding up the resolution process.

Here are some things that would be good to incude in your ticket:
- Your app name and/or Machine ID
- Specific errors in your app logs or browser. What you observed (e.g. 'it threw a 500 error')
- What you were trying to achieve (e.g. deploy the application)
- What you did (e.g. I ran fly deploy)
- UTC timestamps for when the issue occured
- Prepending `LOG_LEVEL=debug` to any flyctl command will give us a great level of insight into the lower-level API calls being made
- If you are sending us error messages or log output, it's best to send that as plain text in the body of the email (or upload a .txt or .log file for longer outputs), rather than attached screenshots of your terminal window.
