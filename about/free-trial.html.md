**Fly.io runs your apps close to your users. This page explains how our free trial works and what resources you can use before you need to add a payment method.**

## Free Trial overview

A free trial on Fly.io includes 2 hours of machine runtime or 7 days of access, whichever comes first. That’s just enough to get a real app up and running before you decide if it’s a fit for you.

<div class="callout">If you hit any of the limits below before your 7 days are up, **your trial is considered exhausted**, and your apps will stop until you add a payment method.</div>

Here’s what’s **included** during the trial:

- **2 total VM hours** (Shared across any machines you launch) <br /> **Note: Trial Machines are set to automatically stop after running for 5 minutes**
- **10 machines max**
- **20GB of volume storage**
- Up to **2 vCPUs per machine**
- **4GB memory per machine**

These are **not included** in the free trial:

- Dedicated IPv4 addresses
- Access to performance-optimized vCPUs
- GPU machines

<div class="callout">You can add a credit card from the dashboard at any time during the trial. This lifts the resource limits and keeps your apps running without interruption. **Note: adding a card ends the free trial** and your usage starts counting toward your bill from that point on.</div>

## Checking usage

You can see what you’ve used and what’s left under **“Trial Status”** in the Fly.io dashboard. Machines usage (including memory) is tracked per second, while Volumes and Machine count are tracked per hour.

The free trial is meant for kicking the tires. Spin something up, poke around, deploy a real app or two. If Fly.io fits your use case, great! Add a credit card to keep going. If not, no hard feelings.

## What happens when the free trial ends?

If you don’t add a payment method by the end of your 7-day trial, or if you use up the included resources, your apps will stop running. You won’t be able to launch new machines, attach volumes, or deploy changes until billing is set up.

Whether you're testing the waters or gearing up to launch something real, the free trial gives you room to get started. If Fly.io feels like a fit, adding a payment method from the Dashboard is all it takes to keep going. No surprises, no downtime, no pressure.
