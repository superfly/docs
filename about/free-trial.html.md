**Fly.io runs your apps close to your users. This page explains how our 7-day free trial works and what resources you can use before you need to add a payment method.**

## Free Trial overview

A free trial on Fly.io lasts for **7 days**, and gives you just enough room to get a real app up and running before you decide if you're in.

Here’s what’s **included** during the trial:

- **2 total VM hours** (shared across any machines you launch)
- **10 machines max**
- **20GB of volume storage**
- Up to **2 vCPUs per machine**
- **4GB memory per machine**

These are **not included** in the free trial:

- Dedicated IPv4 addresses
- Access to performance-optimized vCPUs
- GPU machines

### Checking usage

You can see what you’ve used and what’s left under **“Trial Status”** in the Fly.io dashboard. Machines usage (including memory) is tracked per second, while Volumes and Machine count are tracked per hour.

The free trial is meant for kicking the tires. Spin something up, poke around, deploy a real app or two. If Fly.io fits your use case, great! Add a credit card to keep going. If not, no hard feelings.

If you hit any of these limits before your 7 days are up, your trial is considered **exhausted**, and your apps will stop until you add a payment method.

<div class="callout">You can add a credit card from the dashboard at any time during the trial. This lifts the resource limits and keeps your apps running without interruption. Just a heads-up: adding a card ends the free trial, and from that point on, your usage starts counting toward your bill.</div>

## What happens when the free trial ends?

If you don’t add a payment method by the end of your 7-day trial, or if you use up the included resources, your apps will stop running. You won’t be able to launch new machines, attach volumes, or deploy changes until billing is set up.

Whether you're testing the waters or gearing up to launch something real, the free trial gives you room to get started. If Fly.io feels like a fit, adding a payment method from the Dashboard is all it takes to keep going. No surprises, no downtime, no pressure.
