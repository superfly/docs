The `flyctl` command is your primary way to interact with Fly's Global Application Platform.

If you are doing anything with Fly, you'll need it. We have [flyctl installation instructions](/docs/flyctl/installing/) to guide you through installing it on your system. There's also [flyctl and continuous integration](/docs/flyctl/integrating/) which covers environment variables, JSON and other automation related information about flyctl.
