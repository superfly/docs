The `flyctl` command is your primary way to interact with Fly.io.

If you are doing anything with Fly.io, you'll need it. We have [flyctl installation instructions](/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) to guide you through installing it on your system. There's also [flyctl and continuous integration](/docs/flyctl/integrating/) which covers environment variables, JSON and other automation related information about flyctl.
