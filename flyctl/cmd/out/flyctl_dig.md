Make DNS requests against Fly.io's internal DNS server. Valid types include
AAAA and TXT (the two types our servers answer authoritatively), AAAA-NATIVE
and TXT-NATIVE, which resolve with Go's resolver (they're slower,
but may be useful if diagnosing a DNS bug) and A and CNAME
(if you're using the server to test recursive lookups.)
Note that this resolves names against the server for the current organization. You can
set the organization with -o <org-slug>; otherwise, the command uses the organization
attached to the current app (you can pass an app in with -a <appname>).
