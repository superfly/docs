These pages show you how to deploy a stdio MCP on Fly.io using your choice of the `fly launch`, `fly machine run`, and the machines API.
The example we use in each is the same: the [FileSystem MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) running the [flyio/mcp](https://hub.docker.com/r/flyio/mcp) image on DockerHub image on a Machine with a volume.

If you are looking to deploy a MCP stdio server for yourself, `fly launch` is generally what you need.

If you are looking to deploy MCP servers for your users, the Machines API gives you more knobs and control.

`fly machines run` was originally intended more for experimentation and familiarizing yourself with the platform, but to our surprise it has become popular for use in scripts.
