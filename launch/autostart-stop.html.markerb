Fly Machines are fast to start and stop, and you don't pay for their CPU and RAM when they're in a `stopped` or `suspended` state. For Fly Apps with a service configured, [Fly Proxy](/docs/reference/fly-proxy) can automatically start and stop or suspend existing Machines based on incoming requests, so that your app can meet demand without keeping extra Machines running. You can also set a minimum number of machines to keep running at all times in your primary region.

The autostop/autostart feature also works well for apps that [shut down automatically when idle](#stop-a-machine-by-terminating-its-main-process). The Fly Proxy can still restart your app when there's traffic.

## Configure automatic start and stop

The autostop/autostart settings apply per service, and you set them within the services configured in the `fly.toml` file. See the [[[services]]](/docs/reference/configuration/#the-services-sections) or [[http_service]](/docs/reference/configuration/#the-http_service-section) docs for details.

Example configuration:

```toml
...
[[services]]
  internal_port = 8080
  protocol = "tcp"
  auto_stop_machines = "stop"
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0
...
```

For the preceding example, Fly Proxy will automatically stop Machines when the app has excess capacity and start them again when needed. The app will eventually scale all the way down to zero running Machines if there's no traffic. 

Autostop/autostart setting descriptions:

* `auto_stop_machines`: The action, if any, that Fly Proxy should take when the app is idle for several minutes. Options are `"off"`, `"stop"`, or `"suspend"`.
* `auto_start_machines`: Whether Fly Proxy should automatically start Machines based on requests and capacity.
* `min_machines_running`: The minimum number of Machines to keep running in the primary region when `auto_stop_machines` is set to `"stop"` or `"suspend"`.

Concurrency limits configured for services also affect [how automatic starts and stops work](#how-it-works).

### Default settings

When you create an app using the `fly launch` command, the default settings in `fly.toml` are:

```toml
...
[http_service]
  internal_port = 8080
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = "stop"
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0
...
```

For apps that don't explicitly specify any autostop/autostart settings in `fly.toml`, the Fly Proxy will automatically start stopped Machines when needed, but won't automatically stop or suspend them.

### Recommended settings

If your app already [exits when idle](#stop-a-machine-by-terminating-its-main-process), then you can set `auto_start_machines = true` and `auto_stop_machines = "off"` to have Fly Proxy automatically restart the Machines stopped by your app.

If your app doesn't exit when idle, then we recommend setting `auto_stop_machines` and `auto_start_machines` so that they are both enabled or both disabled, to avoid having Machines that either never start or never stop. For example, if `auto_start_machines = false` and `auto_stop_machines = "stop"`, then Fly Proxy automatically stops your Machines when there's low traffic but doesn't start them again. When all or most of your Machines stop, requests to your app could start failing.

To keep one or more Machines running all the time in your primary region, set `min_machines_running` to `1` or higher. `min_machines_running` has no effect unless you set `auto_stop_machines` to `"stop"` or `"suspend"`.

`min_machines_running` only applies to Machines running in your primary region. If `min_machines_running = 1` and there's no traffic to your app, then Fly Proxy will stop Machines until eventually there is only one Machine running in your primary region.

There's no "maximum machines running" setting, because the maximum number of Machines is the total number of Machines you've created for your app.

## How it works

The Fly Proxy runs a process to automatically start and stop or suspend existing Fly Machines every few minutes.

<div class="callout">
The autostop/autostart feature only works on existing Machines and never creates or destroys Machines for you. The maximum number of running Machines is the number of Machines you've created for your app using `fly scale count` or `fly machine clone`. Learn more about [scaling the number of Machines](/docs/apps/scale-count/).
</div>

### When Fly Proxy stops or suspends Machines

When `auto_stop_machines` is set to `"stop"` or `"suspend"` in your `fly.toml`, the proxy looks at Machines running in a single region and uses the concurrency [`soft_limit` setting](/docs/reference/configuration/#the-http_service-section) for each Machine to determine if there's excess capacity. If the proxy decides there's excess capacity, it stops or suspends exactly one Machine. The proxy repeats this process every few minutes, stopping or suspending only one Machine per region, if needed, each time.

If you have the [`kill_signal` and `kill_timeout` options](/docs/reference/configuration/#runtime-options) configured in your `fly.toml` file, then Fly Proxy uses those settings when it stops a Machine.

Fly Proxy determines excess capacity per region as follows:

* If there's more than one Machine in the region:
  * the proxy determines how many running Machines are over their `soft_limit` setting and then calculates excess capacity: `excess capacity = num of machines - (num machines over soft limit + 1)`
  * if excess capacity is 1 or greater, then the proxy stops or suspends one Machine
* If there's only one Machine in the region:
  * the proxy checks if the Machine has any traffic
  * if the Machine has no traffic (a load of 0), then the proxy stops or suspends the Machine

### When Fly Proxy starts Machines

When `auto_start_machines = true` in your `fly.toml`, the Fly Proxy restarts a Machine in the nearest region when required.

Fly Proxy determines when to start a Machine as follows:

* The proxy waits for a request to your app.
* If all the running Machines are above their `soft_limit` setting, then the proxy starts a stopped or suspended Machine in the nearest region (if there are any stopped or suspended Machines).
* The proxy routes the request to the newly started Machine.

## When to use the autostop/autostart feature

If your app has highly variable request workloads, then you can use `auto_stop_machines` and `auto_start_machines` to manage your Fly Machines as demand decreases and increases. This could reduce costs, because you'll never have to run excess Machines to handle peak load; you'll only run, and get charged for, the number of Machines that you need.

The difference between this feature and what's typical in autoscaling, is that it doesn't create new Machines up to a specified maximum. It automatically starts only existing Machines. For example, if you want to have a maximum of 10 Machines available to service requests, then you need to create 10 Machines for your app.

If you need all your app's Machines to run continuously, then you can set `auto_stop_machines` to `"off"` and `auto_start_machines` to `false`.

If you only need a certain number of your app's Machines to run continuously, then you can set `auto_stop_machines` to `"suspend"` or `"stop"` and `min_machines_running` to `1` or higher. Note that `min_machines_running` only applies to your app's primary region.

## Stop a Machine by terminating its main process

Setting your app to automatically stop or suspend Machines when there's excess capacity using `auto_stop_machines` can be a substitute for when your app doesn't shut itself down automatically after a period of inactivity. If you want a custom shutdown process for your app, then you can code your app to exit when idle.

Here are some examples:

* [Shutting Down a Phoenix App When Idle](https://fly.io/phoenix-files/shut-down-idle-phoenix-app/): a post by Chris McCord on adding a task to an Elixir app's supervision tree that shuts down the Erlang runtime when there are no active connections.
* For Rails apps, the `dockerfile-rails` generator provides a [--max-idle](https://github.com/rubys/dockerfile-rails#addremove-a-feature+external) option that exits after _n_ seconds of inactivity.
* [A Tired Proxy in Go](https://github.com/superfly/tired-proxy+external) used in [Building an In-Browser IDE the Hard Way](https://fly.io/blog/remote-ide-machines/). [There's a community fork with more recent updates](https://community.fly.io/t/improved-tired-proxy-for-use-with-fly-machines/10584).
* A minimal demo app in TypeScript/Remix: [code](https://github.com/fly-apps/autoscale-to-zero-demo+external) & [demo](https://autoscale-to-zero-demo.fly.dev/+external).

Fly Postgres also [supports scaling to zero](https://community.fly.io/t/scale-to-zero-postgres-for-hobby-projects/12212).
