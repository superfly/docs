Searchable application logs is a beta feature. Learn more and post your suggestions or issues in the community thread: [Searchable application logs in Grafana](https://community.fly.io/t/searchable-application-logs-in-grafana/18878+external)
</div>

We’re working with [Quickwit](https://quickwit.io/docs+external) to bring you an application log cluster and search interface. 

You can access searchable logs in Grafana:

- Click **Log Search** in your Fly.io app dashboard, or
- Go directly to your [Grafana metrics](https://fly-metrics.net/d/fly-logs/fly-logs+external)

<div class="important icon">
**Important:** If you’re already signed in to Grafana, then you'll need to log out and log back in.
</div>

Searchable logs are built on our [Tigris Storage](/docs/reference/tigris/) and [Supabase Postgres](/docs/reference/supabase/) extensions. 

For the beta period, log search is free and we retain logs for 30 days. Learn how to build more complex queries [Quickwit’s query language](https://quickwit.io/docs/get-started/query-language-intro+external).
