Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. 

Spinning up a flask app is fun! 

## _Speedrun_

<%= partial "/docs/languages-and-frameworks/partials/flyctl" %>

<%= partial "/docs/python/partials/speedrun", locals: { runtime: "Flask", repo: "hello-flask-uv" }  %>

## _Deploy a Flask app from scratch_

<%= partial "/docs/python/partials/uv_init", locals: { runtime: "Flask" }  %>

To run this app we will need 2 dependencies:

- flask: the framework
- gunicorn: the server

```cmd
uv add flask gunicorn
```

Now let's create a basic app in `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_fly():
    return "hello from fly.io"
```

To check that everything is working, we can use the included flask cli tool:

```cmd
flask run
```
```out
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
```

Note that `flask run` command works since our file is named `app.py`. It also works if your file is named `wsgi.py`, so you don't have to use [`--app`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/cli/) to tell Flask where your app is. More details [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/quickstart/#a-minimal-application).

If your file is saved as `hello.py` instead of `app.py`, you would need to use the `--app` option to point to Flask where your app is: 

```cmd
flask --app hello run
```

If you open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser, it should display `hello from fly.io`.
