Now that we have a functioning `ollama` with a model, we have to expose the ollama host to our app. One way to do this is to set the host as a secret:

```cmd
fly secrets set OLLAMA_HOST=http://<your-app>.flycast
```

To interact with our new AI friend, we will have to install the `ollama` package:

```cmd
poetry add ollama
```

Now we can initialize the client:

```python
import os
from ollama import AsyncClient

OLLAMA_HOST = os.getenv('OLLAMA_HOST')
ollama_client = AsyncClient(OLLAMA_HOST)
```

From here we can start integrating it into our app:

```python
@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    resp = await ollama_client.generate(
        model="llama3.1",
        prompt="Why is the sky not green?",
    )
    return resp["response"]
```

When you re-deploy your app you should see llama's answer:

```cmd
fly deploy
```
