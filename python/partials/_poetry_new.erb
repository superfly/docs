For managing our project, we use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). 
For more information on the initial setup with poetry, refer to [setting up a python environment](/docs/python/the-basics/initial-setup).
We can initialize a new project like so:

```cmd
poetry new <%= runtime.downcase %>-app
cd <%= runtime.downcase %>-app
poetry shell
```
