## Fly Machines

Machines are fast-launching VMs—and the engine of the Fly.io platform.

They're also a low-level interface to deploy and scale out your application with precise control.

## Fly Launch

Fly Launch is configuration, provisioning, deployment, scaling, and orchestration with flyctl, built on Fly Machines.
