A Postgres cluster is configured with three users when created:

- `postgres` - a role with superuser and login privileges that was created for you along with the cluster. Since the `postgres` role has superuser rights, it's recommended that you only use it for admin tasks and create new users with access restricted to the minimum necessary for applications
- `flypgadmin` - a role used internally by Fly.io to configure and query the Postgres cluster
- `repmgr` - a role used by repmgr to manage replication for the Postgres cluster

If you [attached a Fly App](/docs/postgres/managing/attach-detach/) to your Postgres cluster app with `fly postgres attach`, then you'll have a an additional database and user with the same name as the consuming app.

You can list users with flyctl. For example, for a Postgres cluster app named `pg-test`:

```cmd
fly postgres users list --app pg-test
```

```output
NAME          	SUPERUSER	DATABASES
my_app_name	    yes      	my_app_name, postgres, repmgr
flypgadmin    	yes      	my_app_name, postgres, repmgr
postgres      	yes      	my_app_name, postgres, repmgr
repmgr        	yes      	my_app_name, postgres, repmgr
```

In this example, there's an attached Fly App in the list of users.
