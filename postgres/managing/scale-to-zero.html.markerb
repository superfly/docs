title: Scale to zero for Postgres Development projects
objective: Learn about the scale to zero after one hour feature, and how to remove it, for your Postgres Development project.

<div class="callout">
The scale to zero feature is only available for new Postgres clusters that use the Development configuration. The one hour timeout is not configurable.
</div>

If you select the Development configuration when you [create your Fly Postgres app](/docs/postgres/getting-started/create-pg-cluster/), then you also get the option to have your database scale down to zero after one hour.

After one hour, if there are no open connections, then the database shuts down and waits to restart until something tries to connect again. If there are open connections, then the database stays running and checks for open connections again in one hour.

<div class="callout">
You might need to configure any apps that connect to your Postgres app to scale to zero as well, otherwise your Postgres database will never have zero connections and will never scale down. Your app might also need to be able to wait for the database to start back up. You can learn more about [making apps exit when idle](/docs/launch/autostart-stop/#stop-a-machine-by-terminating-its-main-process).

## Turn off the scale to zero feature

The scale to zero feature is controlled by the `FLY_SCALE_TO_ZERO` environment variable.

To turn off scale to zero, you first need to get and save the `fly.toml` file locally, since the automated Postgres creation process doesn't generate a `fly.toml` file in the working directory.

```
fly config save --app <app-name>
```

Open the `fly.toml` file and remove the following line from the `[env]` section:

```
  FLY_SCALE_TO_ZERO = "1h"
```

Verify what image youâ€™re running:

```
fly image show --app <app-name>
```

Finally, deploy your changes. For example:

```
fly deploy . --image flyio/postgres-flex:15.2
```
