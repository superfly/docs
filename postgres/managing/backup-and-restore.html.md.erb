Fly.io performs daily storage-based snapshots of each of your provisioned volumes. These snapshots can
be used to restore your dataset into a new Postgres application.

## Listing snapshots

Snapshots are volume specific, so you need to identify the volume whose snapshot you want to restore from. You can list your volumes by running the `volumes list` command with your Postgres app name.

```cmd
fly volumes list -a <postgres-app-name>
```
```output
ID                   NAME    SIZE REGION ATTACHED VM CREATED AT
vol_x915grn008vn70qy pg_data 10GB atl    b780ce3d    2 weeks ago
vol_ke628r677pvwmnpy pg_data 10GB atl    359d0e24    2 weeks ago
```

Once you have identified which volume to target, you can list its snapshots:
```cmd
fly volumes snapshots list <volume-id>
```
```output
ID                  SIZE   CREATED AT
vs_2AjJ4lGqQwDbRfxm 29 MiB 2 hours ago
vs_BAARBQxZKl6JKU04 27 MiB 1 day ago
vs_OPQXXna6kA2Qnhz8 26 MiB 2 days ago
```
## Restoring from a snapshot

To restore a Postgres application from a snapshot, simply specify the `--snapshot-id` argument when running the `create` command as shown below:
```cmd
fly postgres create --snapshot-id <snapshot-id>
```
