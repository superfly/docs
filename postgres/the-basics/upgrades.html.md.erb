You can update a Postgres cluster that was provisioned with `fly postgres create` to the latest [release](https://github.com/fly-apps/postgres-ha/releases), using [`fly image update`](/docs/flyctl/image-update/), _but only if that doesn't require a Postgres major version upgrade_.

Check your current image with [`fly status`](/docs/flyctl/status/):

```cmd
fly status -a <postgres-app-name>
```

And upgrade with:

```cmd
fly image update -a <postgres-app-name>
```

The update won't go ahead if the major Postgres version in your existing Postgres app does not match that in the newest postgres-ha version.

Currently, upgrading Postgres across major versions requires provisioning a new cluster and restoring your old database into it.
