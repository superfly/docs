You can upgrade a Fly Postgres cluster across minor Postgres versions with [`fly image update`](/docs/flyctl/image-update/). This updates your VMs to the [latest release](https://github.com/fly-apps/postgres-ha/releases) of the [postgres-ha](https://github.com/fly-apps/postgres-ha) app

Check your current image with [`fly status`](/docs/flyctl/status/):

```cmd
fly status -a <postgres-app-name>
```

And upgrade with:

```cmd
fly image update -a <postgres-app-name>
```

The update won't go ahead if the major Postgres version in your existing Postgres app does not match that in the newest postgres-ha release.

Upgrading Postgres across major versions is more complicated, and right now the way to do this is to provision a new cluster and restore a backup of your database data into it.
