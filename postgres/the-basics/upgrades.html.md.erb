You can update a Postgres cluster that was provisioned with `flyctl postgres create` to the latest [release](https://github.com/fly-apps/postgres-ha/releases), using [`flyctl image update`](/docs/flyctl/image-update/).

Check your current image with [`flyctl status`](/docs/flyctl/status/):

```cmd
flyctl status -a <postgres-app-name>
```

And upgrade with:

```cmd
flyctl image update -a <postgres-app-name>
```
