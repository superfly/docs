You can use `flyctl status` to see a list of VMs and their status. The output for each VM includes it's role within the cluster.

```
$ flyctl status --app test-pg
ID              STATE   ROLE    REGION  HEALTH CHECKS       IMAGE                         CREATED               UPDATED

```

To view the status of an individual Machine:

```
$ flyctl machine status e784079b449483 --app test-pg

## Logs

Fly Postgres apps run several processes inside each VM, including postgres, stolon keeper, stolon sentinel, stolon proxy, and postgres_export. Each of those processes redirect STDOUT and STDERR to logs which you can view with `flyctl logs`.

## Metrics

Fly Postgres apps export metrics to prometheus which can be seen in the Metrics UI or queried from grafana.

The available metrics are
```
pg_stat_activity_count
pg_stat_activity_max_tx_duration
pg_stat_archiver_archived_count
pg_stat_archiver_failed_count
pg_stat_bgwriter_buffers_alloc
pg_stat_bgwriter_buffers_backend_fsync
pg_stat_bgwriter_buffers_backend
pg_stat_bgwriter_buffers_checkpoint
pg_stat_bgwriter_buffers_clean
