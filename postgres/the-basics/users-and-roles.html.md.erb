A Postgres cluster is configured with three users when created:

- `postgres` - a role with superuser and login privileges that was created for you along with the cluster. Since the `postgres` role has superuser rights, it's recommended that you only use it for admin tasks and create new users with access restricted to the minimum necessary for applications
- `flypgadmin` - this role is used internally by Fly.io to configure and query the Postgres cluster
- `repluser` - this is the user replica servers use for replication from the leader

You can view a list of users using `flyctl`:

```cmd
flyctl postgres users list pg-test
```

```output
Running flyadmin user-list
USERNAME   SUPERUSER DATABASES
flypgadmin true      postgres
postgres   true      postgres
repluser   false     postgres
```
