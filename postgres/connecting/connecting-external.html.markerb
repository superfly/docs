title: External Connections
objective: Access Postgres from a different Fly internal private network, or from outside Fly.io entirely.

Fly Postgres databases can be used by applications outside their Fly.io [internal private network](/docs/reference/private-networking/); this means in a different private network belonging to your organization, in another Fly organization, or outside Fly.io altogether.

We don't expose Postgres apps to the internet by default. To get this working, you'll need to make two adaptations: configuring your Postgres app to accept connections from the Fly proxy, and providing a publicly-resolvable hostname to your app.

## Allocate an IP address

If you haven't already, you will need to allocate a public IP address to your Postgres app. You can view your list of IPs by running the following command from your application directory:
```cmd
fly ips list --app <pg-app-name>
```

You can allocate an IPv4 address by running the following:
```cmd
fly ips allocate-v4 --app <pg-app-name>
```
If your network supports IPv6:
```cmd
fly ips allocate-v6 --app <pg-app-name>
```

## Configure an external service

Now that you have an IP address, it's time to configure your app to accept connections on an external port, and direct incoming requests to your Postgres instance.

Pull down a `fly.toml` configuration file for your Postgres app, if you don't have it:

```cmd
fly config save --app <pg-app-name>
```

Note that this could overwrite a `fly.toml` in the current directory, so be careful!

Open up your `fly.toml` file.

This may come with a default `services` section for `internal_port` 8080. Replace that with the following to configure your port mappings to work with Postgres:

```toml
[[services]]
  internal_port = 5432 # Postgres instance
  protocol = "tcp"

[[services.ports]]
  handlers = ["pg_tls"]
  port = 5432
```

Note the use of the `pg_tls` [handler](/docs/reference/services/#connection-handlers) to manage the specific requirements of Postgres connections.

For additional information on services and service ports:
[The services sections](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/#the-services-sections)

## Deploy with the new configuration

Once your service has been set up in `fly.toml`, it's time to deploy with the new configuration.

Verify the version of Postgres you are running.  **This step is important, because [there can be changes in the internal storage format between major versions of Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html).**

Figure out which image and tag (Postgres version) you’re on:

```cmd
fly image show --app <pg-app-name>
```
```out
Image Details
  Registry   = registry-1.docker.io
  Repository = flyio/postgres
  Tag        = 14.4
  Version    = v0.0.32
```

Deploy your cluster, using `--image` with the `image:tag` found in the previous step:

```cmd
fly deploy . --app <pg-app-name> --image flyio/postgres:<major-version>
```

As an example, if you are running Postgres 14.x you would specify `flyio/postgres:14` as your target image. 

After the deployment completes, you can verify your `services` configuration by running the `fly info` command:

```cmd
fly info
```
```output
...

Services
PROTOCOL	PORTS                	FORCE HTTPS
TCP     	5432 => 5432 [PG_TLS]	False
...
```

You should then be able to access your Postgres cluster via psql like:

```cmd
psql "sslmode=require host=<pg-app-name>.fly.dev dbname=<db name> user=<username>"
```
```out
Password for user <username>:
psql (14.5 (Homebrew), server 13.6 (Debian 13.6-1.pgdg110+1))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

<db name>=#
```

## Adapting the connection string

The connection string that `fly pg create` outputs for use in consuming apps is in the form:

```
postgres://{username}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/{database}?options
```

where the `hostname` is an internal one. Substitute your newly publicly reachable hostname (`<pg-app-name>.fly.dev`) here to get a connection string an external app can use.
