These examples demonstrate connections from within the same Fly.io internal IPv6 private network . To adapt them for external connections, substitute the internal hostname for one that's reachable over the public Internet.

## psql

If you have an active [WireGuard tunnel](/docs/reference/private-networking/#private-network-vpn) to your organization's private network, you can connect from a local machine to your Postgres cluster the same way you would from a Fly app within the same private network. For example, the following command would start an interactive terminal session on the cluster leader with `psql`:

```cmd
psql postgres://postgres:secret123@appname.internal:5432
```

You can, of course, run psql from a shell on a Fly app as well (as long as that app has psql installed).

## Connecting with Ruby 
[docs](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg)

Ruby apps use the `pg` gem to connect to postgres.

```ruby
require 'pg'

# Output a table of current connections to the DB
conn = PG.connect("postgres://postgres:secret123@postgresapp.internal:5432/yourdb")
conn.exec( "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity" ) do |result|
  puts "     PID | User             | Query"
  result.each do |row|
    puts " %7d | %-16s | %s " %
      row.values_at('pid', 'usename', 'query')
  end
end
```

## Connecting with Rails 
[docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database)

Rails apps automatically connect to the database specified in the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

You can set this variable manually with `flyctl secrets set`
```bash
flyctl secrets set DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:secret123@postgresapp.internal:5432/yourdb
```

or by attaching the Postgres database to your Fly app.


### Connecting with Go 
[docs](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/wiki/Getting-started-with-pgx-through-database-sql)

`pgx` is the recommended driver for connecting to postgres. It supports the standard `database/sql` interface as well as directly exposing low level / high performance APIs.

First, add `github.com/jackc/pgx/v4` as a module depepdency.
```bash
go get github.com/jackc/pgx/v4
```

The following program will connect to the database in `DATABASE_URL` and run a query.
```go
package main

import (
  "database/sql"
  "fmt"
  "os"

  _ "github.com/jackc/pgx/v4/stdlib"
)

func main() {
  db, err := sql.Open("pgx", os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL"))
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Unable to connect to database: %v\n", err)
    os.Exit(1)
  }
  defer db.Close()

  var greeting string
  err = db.QueryRow("select 'Hello, world!'").Scan(&greeting)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "QueryRow failed: %v\n", err)
    os.Exit(1)
  }

  fmt.Println(greeting)
}
```

### Connecting with Node.js 
[docs](https://node-postgres.com)

You'll use the `pg` npm module to connect to Postgres from a Node.js app.

```javascript
const { Client } = require('pg')
const client = new Client({connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL})

await client.connect()
const res = await client.query('SELECT $1::text as message', ['Hello world!'])
console.log(res.rows[0].message) // Hello world!
await client.end()
```

### Connecting with Prisma – Node.js 
[docs](https://www.prisma.io/)

Prisma is an open-source object-relational mapper (ORM) for Node.js and works with both JavaScript and TypeScript. It consists of 3 components:
- Prisma Client - a type-safe query builder 
- Prisma Migrate - a data modeling and migration tool
- Prisma Studio - a modern intuitive GUI for interacting with your database


<details>
<summary>Set up Prisma in your project</summary>

Install the Prisma CLI and Prisma Client dependencies in your project

```
npm i --save-dev prisma
npm i @prisma/client
```

Initialize Prisma in your project:

```
npx prisma init
```
This command does the following:
- Creates a folder called `prisma` at the root of your project
- Creates a `.env` file at the root of your project if it doesn't exist
- Creates a `schema.prisma` file inside the `prisma` folder. This is the file that you will use to model your data

Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` to your PostgreSQL database
```
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:secret123@postgresapp.internal:5432/yourdb"
```

If you are working in a brownfield project, you can introspect your database to generate the models in your `schema.prisma` file:

```
npx prisma db pull
```

</details>

Assuming you have the following model in your `schema.prisma` file:

Add a model to your `schema.prisma` file:

```groovy
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider  = "prisma-client-js"
}

model Post {
  id       Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  content  String?
}
```

You can query your database using Prisma as follows: 
```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  const posts = await prisma.post.findMany()

  const newPost = await prisma.post.create({
    data: {
      title: 'PostgreSQL on Fly',
      content: 'https://fly.io/docs/reference/postgres'
    }
  })
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```
