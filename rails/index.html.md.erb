## Create a Rails App

Let's create a Rails blog for our first Fly app. This guide assumes you have Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL installed on your workstation.

```cmd
rails new blog -d postgresql
```

This generates a bunch of Rails files that will be used for your application. The `-d` flag tells Rails that we're going to use Postrges for the database, which is what Fly recommends for production Rails apps.

When the command is finished, change into that directory:

```cmd
cd blog
```

Now lets create the database on your workstatation:

```cmd
bin/rails db:create
```

Then generate the blog scaffolding:

```cmd
bin/rails generate scaffold Post title:string body:text
```

The scaffolding creates a database migration. Run the following command to create the `posts` table in your local Postgres database:

```cmd
bin/rails db:create
```

Once that's complete, open the `config/routes.rb` file and add `root "posts#index"` so that it looks like this:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :posts
  root "posts#index"
end
```

Congrats! You now have a Blog. Let's deploy it to production.

## Provision Rails and Postgres Servers

To configure and launch the app, you can use `fly launch` and follow the wizard:

```cmd
fly launch
```
```output
Creating app in ~/Projects/blog
Scanning source code
Detected a Rails app
? App Name (leave blank to use an auto-generated name): blog
Automatically selected personal organization: John Smith
? Select region: sjc (San Jose, California (US))
Created app blog in organization personal
Set secrets on blog: RAILS_MASTER_KEY
Wrote config file fly.toml
? Would you like to setup a Postgresql database now? Yes
For pricing information visit: https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/#postgresql-clusters
? Select configuration: Development - Single node, 1x shared CPU, 256MB RAM, 1GB disk
Creating postgres cluster blog-db in organization personal
Postgres cluster blog-db created
  Username:    postgres
  Password:    <redacted>
  Hostname:    blog-db.internal
  Proxy Port:  5432
  PG Port: 5433
Save your credentials in a secure place, you won't be able to see them again!
```

You can set a name for the app, choose a default region, and choose to launch and attach a Postgresql database.

Deploying your application is done with the following command:

```
fly deploy
```

Once it's done, you can use `fly status` to check the app's status and deployment, and you should see something like this:

```cmd
fly status
```
```output
App
  Name     = blog
  Owner    = personal
  Version  = 0
  Status   = running
  Hostname = blog.fly.dev

Deployment Status
  ID          = c3ca80bf-4034-837a-ce92-682e6528c5c7
  Version     = v0
  Status      = successful
  Description = Deployment completed successfully
  Instances   = 1 desired, 1 placed, 1 healthy, 0 unhealthy

Instances
ID        PROCESS VERSION REGION  DESIRED STATUS  HEALTH CHECKS       RESTARTS  CREATED
748868bc  app     0       lhr     run     running 1 total, 1 passing  0         20s ago
```

If you elected to provision a Postgres database during setup, it's deployed as a seperate Fly app to `blog-db`.

## Configuring an existing Rails application

If you've got an existing Rails app, and you want to set it up for Fly, the process is pretty similar;
`fly launch` will take you through the setup steps, but there's a couple of things to look at first.

If your Rails application wasn't created with the `--database=postgresql` option
and you didn't subsequently add the Postgres gem to your bundle, do so now
via:

```cmd
bundle add pg --group production
```

Your database settings will be passed to your app via a `DATABASE_URL` environment
variable (which Rails picks up automatically). That means you can drop a lot of the production configuration from `config/database.yml`.

If you've got your app's secrets stored in an encrypted credentials file such as `config/credentials.yml.enc`
or `config/credentials/production.yml.enc`, you'll need to provide the master key to your app via
`fly secrets set`. For example, if your master key is stored in `config/master.key`, you can run:

```cmd
fly secrets set RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(cat config/master.key)
```

## Next steps

At this point you now have a basic Rails application running that points at a Postgres database, but most Rails applications need more then that like access to a Redis database for caching and background workers. Read through [the basics](/docs/rails/the-basics) to setup the remainder of your Rails application.
