Fly is a great place to run Rails applications, especially if you plan on running them on multiple servers around the world so your users have a fast, snappy, low-latency experience. This becomes particularly important if you're deploying a Hotwire Rails app.

## [Getting Started](./getting-started)

Run through the [Starter Rails App](./getting-started/) guide to get a feel for what it's like to deploy to Fly. If you're short on time, just do the first section and you'll have a Rails app running in just a few minutes.

## [The Basics](./the-basics)

Covers everything you need to setup, run, and manage production Rails apps on Fly. These documents should give you an idea of what's actually like day-to-day using Fly.

## [Advanced Guides](./advanced-guides)

The topics in these documents either apply to a subset of Rails applications or are things you'd do if your application demands scale.
