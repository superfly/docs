Deploying applications to Fly can be as simple as running:

```cmd
fly deploy
```

When the application successfully deploys, you can quickly open it in the browser by running:

```cmd
fly apps open
```

If all goes well, you should see a running application in your web browser. You can also view a history of deployments by running:

```cmd
fly releases
```
```output

v50     true    scale succeeded Scale VM count: ["web, 3"]              kurt@fly.io           2022-08-08T19:55:23Z
```

## Troubleshooting a deployment

If a deployment fails, you'll see an error message in the console. If the error is a Rails stack trace, it will be truncated. To view the entire error message run:

```cmd
fly logs
```

You may need to open another terminal window and deploy again while running `fly logs` to see the full error message.

## Running migrations

Migrations are configured to automatically run after each deployment via the following task in your application's `lib/tasks/fly.rake` file:

```ruby
task :release => 'db:migrate'
```

To disable automatic migrations for deploys, remove the dependency from the `:release` task. Then, to manually run migrations after a deployment, run:

```cmd
fly ssh console -C "/rails/bin/rails db:migrate"
```

## Run ad-hoc tasks after deploying

Sometimes after a deployment you'll need to run a script or migration in production. That can be accomplished with the Fly SSH console by running:

```cmd
fly ssh console
```
```output
Connecting to top1.nearest.of.my-rails-app.internal... complete
```
```cmd
cd app
ls
```
```output
Aptfile       CHANGELOG.md  Dockerfile    LICENSE     README.md  app   config.ru  fly     package.json       pull_request_template.md  test    yarn.lock
Brewfile      CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md  Gemfile       Procfile      Rakefile   bin   db     lib     postcss.config.js  resources           tmp
Brewfile.lock.json  CONTRIBUTING.md Gemfile.lock  Procfile.dev  SECURITY.md  config  docs     node_modules  public       tailwind.config.js        vendor
```
```cmd
bundle exec ruby my-hello-world-script.rb
```
```output
hello world
```

## Asset compilation and build commands

The default Rails image is configured to run `assets:precompile` in your application's `lib/tasks/fly.rake` file:

```ruby
task :build => 'assets:precompile'
```

If you have additional build steps beyond the Rails asset precompiler, you may need to modify your application's `lib/tasks/fly.rake` file.
