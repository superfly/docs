## Initial Dockerfile

Below is a minimal, multi-stage build, Dockerfiler that is capable of
supporting both ActiveRecord and Action Cable:


```dockerfile
<%= dockerfile "docs/rails/cookbooks/databases/Dockerfile1" do |patch|
  patch[/RUN bin\/rails.*EOF/m] = [
    'COPY <<-"EOF" /demo/config/routes.rb',
    'Rails.application.routes.draw { root "rails/welcome#index" }',
    'EOF'
  ].join("\n")
end
%>
```

This Dockerfile contains a number of small changes from the minimal
one:

  * For Active Record (or more precisely, sqlite3) to work, we need to add
    `pkg-config` to the list of packages installed via `apt-get`.
  * For Action Cable to work, we need to add `redis` to the list
    of packages installed via `apt-get`.
  * `--minimal` and `--skip-active-record` are removed from the
    `rails new` line.
  * Since the example below uses Tailwindcss, we need to add `--css tailwind` to the
    `rails new` line.
  * We need to add `RUN bin/rails assets:precompile` and
    `RUN bin/rails db:prepare` immediately after the
    `ENV RAILS_ENV=production` line.
  * In order to see the log messages, add `ENV RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true`
    after the `ENV PORT=8080` line.
  * We need to serve the assets.  Chose one of the following two methods:
      * Set `ENV RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true`
      * Add to the bottom of `fly.toml`:

        ```
        [[statics]]
        guest_path = "/demo/public"
        url_prefix = "/"
        ```

In general, requests that never make it to Rails are served fastest, so
the second approach where fly serves the static files is the better approach.

## Example application

In order to demonstrate Action Cable and Active Record functionality, we need
a Rails application.  Following is a simple visitors counter.

Replace the three lines starting with
`COPY <<-"EOF" config/routes.rb` with the following:

```dockerfile
<%= dockerfile 'docs/rails/cookbooks/databases/Dockerfile1' do |patch|
  patch[/RUN bin\/rails.*EOF/m]
end %>
```

Since this isn't a Rails tutorial, an overview of the contents will suffice:

  * A `Vistor` model with a single counter column.
  * A `Counter` channel to send realtime updates.
  * A controller method that updates the model, broadcasts the results,
    and renders the initial page.
  * HTML that connects to the channel, displays the fly.io logo, and
    renders a partial.
  * A partial that shows the counter inside a turbo frame.
  * A route that connects the root to the controller method we defined above.

## Setting up Redis

Before we deploy this application, we need to 
create the redis database.  We will be using
[Redis by Upstash](https://fly.io/docs/reference/redis/), and creating
the database and connecting it to the demo application is a matter
of issuing two commands:


```
flyctl redis create
flyctl secrets set \
  REDIS_URL=redis://default:REDACTED@NAME-redis.upstash.io
```

Replace the secret with the private URL provided by the `redis create` command.
And you don't need to split the `secrets set` line, that was merely done to
fit in your browser window.

If you have deployed the minimal application previously, 
at this point, your application has been redeployed, and you can visit the
page to see a counter.  If you open multiple windows, each will be updated
simultaneously.  If you haven't launched and deployed the application previously
do it now.

## Making a persistent sqlite3 database

The counter itself needs to be saved in a database, and by default that
database is sqlite3 for Rails.  For that database to be kept intact
across deploys it needs to be placed on a
[volume](https://fly.io/docs/reference/volumes/).

We can create a volume using the CLI:

```
flyctl volumes create sqlite3_volume
```

To use this volume, we are going to need to mount it and set an
environment variable relocating the database to be on that volume.
We can do both by editing `fly.toml`:

```toml
[env]
  DATABASE_URL = "sqlite3:///mnt/volume/production.sqlite3"

[mounts]
  source = "sqlite3_volume"
  destination = "/mnt/volume"
```

One last problem remains: the `db:prepare` step needs to be run *after*
the volume is mounted, which means that it needs to run on the deployment
machine, not on the build machine.  This means that in your Dockerfile
this needs to be done by the CMD statement not on a RUN statement.

Start by removing `RUN bin/rails db:prepare`, then replace the CMD
statement with:

```
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "bin/rails db:prepare; bin/rails server"]
```

The issue here is that Dockerfiles are limited to one CMD statement.
An alternative solution is to create a script (perhaps using a "here"
document), and have the CMD run that script.

The next time you deploy after this change you will start with
a new database.  After that, all future deploys will use the
same database.

Before proceeding to the next step, run `flyctl volumes list` to
find the volume id.  Delete the volume using `flyctl volumes delete`.
Also remove the `DATABASE_URL` from the `[env]` section and
delete the `[mounts]` section.

## Changing the database to Postgresql

Postgresql is an alternative to sqlite3.  To use it, you will need to
install a library and a gem:

  * Add `libpq-dev` to the `apt-get install` line.
  * Add `--database postgresql` to the `rails new` line.

Once again, knowing what libraries to install is a matter of knowing
Debian conventions: [libps-dev](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libpq-dev).
Digging deeper into the [filelist](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/amd64/libpq-dev/filelist),
there is one file, `libpq.so` that needs to be available at deploy time.

One approach is to add a copy line:

```
COPY --from=build /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
```

Another is to install something that includes it that might be needed anyway at deploy time,
such as `postgresql-client`.  Since this will be on the deploy image the multi-stage build
approach of install and copy only what you need needs to be reversed: install and remove
what you don't need.  That's why you will often see lines like the following in Dockerfiles:

```
RUN apt-get update -qq && \
    apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y \
    postgresql-client \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists /var/cache/apt/archives
```

Now you are ready to create a postgres cluster:

```
flyctl postgres create
```

When done, you will find a link to
[This Is Not Managed Postgres ](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/getting-started/what-you-should-know/).  That information may be useful in the future so
bookmark the link (or return back to this page), but Fly Postgres is
fine for this demo.

Your postgres app will be assigned a name if you didn't provide one.
Find that name and then run:

```
flyctl postgres attach happy-store-1234
```

... replacing the name with the one assigned or selected by you. 

Before proceeding, there is one more change that might be worth making.
If you ever plan to scale up to multiple application machines it would
be better to run `db:prepare` exactly once per deploy rather than once
per vm.  You can accomplish this by adding the following to your `fly.toml`:

```
[deploy]
  release_command = "bin/rails db:prepare"
```

Then restore the CMD line in your Dockerfile:

```
CMD bin/rails server
```

## Changing the database to MySQL

[MySQL on Fly](https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/mysql-on-fly/)
is more of a do it yourself kinda thing at the moment.  Follow that
guide to set up a MySQL application.

Once you have it up and running, the instructions are roughly
the same as with postgresql, with the following modifications:

  * On the rails new line, specify `--database mysql` instead of `--database postgresql`
  * [default-libmysqlclient-dev](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/default-libmysqlclient-dev) 
    is the package containing the mysql libraries.
  * [default-mysql-client](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/default-mysql-client)
    is the package containing the mysql client.
  * Add the deploy release command to `fly.toml` from the postgresql instructions above.
  * You need to run `fly secrets set DATABASE_URL=` in your
    application.  For postgresql this is taken care of for you
    by the `flyctl postgres attach` command.  This will look
    something like the following:

     ```
     fly secrets set DATABASE_URL=mysql2://root:password@mysql-app-name.internal:3306/
     ```

## Recap

* Adding databases require a lot of configuration:
  * Much of the configuration involve actions outside your Dockerfile: i.e,
    setting up volumes, secrets, virtual machines, etc.
  * While Dockerfiles don't reduce the number of steps required, they do provide
    a place where these actions can be captured concisely and reproducible executed.
* Knowing what packages to add and where shared libraries are to be found is once again
  requires more knowledge of operating system conventions (in this case Debian) than
  Docker knowledge.
