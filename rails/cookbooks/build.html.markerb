# Ordering steps

The initial cookbooks in this series seemed to automatically cache
build steps and perform predictably - make a change to the Dockerfile
and the build will pick up from the point of the change.

In such cases, when there are steps that can be executed in order
it is a good idea to order the steps that take longest and/or are
least likely to change earlier than quick steps that may change
more frequently.

This works well until you get to the point where steps need
to be ordered.

Now that you are copying sources from outside of the Dockerfile,
a change to *any* source will trigger a rebuild from the point
of the COPY statement on, including time consuming steps like
`bundle install` and `yarn install`.

The relevant portion of the Dockerfile looks something like
the following:

```
COPY . .
RUN bundle install
```

Splitting that into two copy statements can make a dramatic
improvement in build times:

```
COPY Gemfile* .
RUN bundle install
COPY . .
```

As the first statement will only copy `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`,
the time consuming `bundle install` step will *only* be run if these
two specific files have changed.

This can result in a dramatic reduction in build times for cases
where the Gemfile did not change.

# Multi-stage builds

Now consider `bundle install` and `yarn install`.  Both can be
time consuming.  They can be run in either order.  If run sequentially,
you will be faced with a choice: should a change to the `Gemfile`
result in an unnecessary reinstall of node modules, or should a
change to `package.json` result in an unnecessary reinstall of gems?

We've seen how multi-stage builds can reduce image size.  They also
can be used to reduce build times.  An example to illustrate:

```
FROM ruby:slim as base
RUN apt-get install -y build-essential &&
    volta install node@lts yarn@latest

WORKDIR /demo

FROM base as gems
COPY Gemfile* .
RUN bundle install

FROM base as node
COPY package*.json .
RUN yarn install

FROM base
RUN apt-get install -y postgresql-client

COPY . .
COPY --from=gems /usr/local/bundle /usr/local/bundle
COPY --from=node /demo/node-modules /demo/node-modules
```

Such a Dockerfile will only run `bundle install` if the `Gemfile`
has changed, and only run `yarn install` if `package.json`
changed.

Even better, if both changed, they will be run concurrently.
In fact, on the first run they will be run concurrently with
the installation of `postgresql-client`.

# Caching

We've seen how splitting COPY statements can reduce the number of
steps, but it still remains the case that any change to the Gemfile
will result in reinstalling all gems.

This can be improved by using the
[dedicated RUN cache](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/#id=%22use-the-dedicated-run-cache%22).

Applied to bundle installs, the resulting build instructions would
look something like the following:

```
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=dev-gem-cache,sharing=locked,target=/srv/vendor \
    bundle config set app_config .bundle && \
    bundle config set without 'development test' && \
    bundle config set path /srv/vendor && \
    bundle install && \
    bundle clean && \
    mkdir -p vendor && \
    bundle config set path vendor && \
    cp -ar /srv/vendor .
```

That's a lot to unpack.  Statement by statement:

 * a `gem-cache` directory is mounted on `/srv/vendor`
 * the bundle config directory is set to be a `.bundle` subdirectory
   of the current application.
 * gems marked as *development* or *test* in the Gemfile are not to be
    installed.
 * the bundle directory is set to the `/srv/vendor` directory
 * the install is performed
 * unused gems are removed
 * a vendor subdirectory is created.
 * the bundle directory is changed to be  `vendor` subdirectory
 * the contents of the `/srv/vendor` cache is copied to the
   vendor subdirectory.

The final build stage can copy the entire app directory from
the build stage that included the above `RUN` statement to
pick up the configuration as well as the gems.

With this in place, adding a single gem to your Gemfile will
result in only the installation of that one gem.

## recap

Starting from a simple sequence of two statements (potentially three
if `yarn install` is added) we have explored a number of techniques
involving ordering, splitting, staging, and caching of statements
and results.

We started with something that was simple and slow and ended with
a solution that is considerably less simple but decidedly faster.

This results in a trade-off.  For small projects it may make
sense to only adopt some of these techniques to keep the
Dockerfile maintainable.  For other projects it may make
sense to incorporate more.
