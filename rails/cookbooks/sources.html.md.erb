In the cookbooks so far, you've seen COPY statements with heredocs, and COPY
statements with `--from` options.  This page contains a number of recipes
which you an add to an existing Dockerfile to incorporate content from outside
of the  Dockerfile.

The way to do this is extremely simple.  As an example, the following statements
will copy the contents of your current directory (recursively) into the image:

```
COPY . .
```

So you would think that with an existing Rails project you could remove a lot
of statements and replace them with a single COPY statement.  Generally it turns
out that the reverse is true.  For starters what once was:

```dockerfile
RUN gem install rails
RUN rails new demo --minimal --skip-active-record
```

Becomes

```dockerfile
RUN mkdir demo
WORKDIR demo
COPY . .
RUN bundle install
RUN yarn install
```

And then even with that change, when you try to deploy you get a message that looks something like this:

```
#14 0.539 Your Ruby version is 3.2.0, but your Gemfile specified 3.1.2
```

## Versioning

The fix for this is simple.  You change your base image.  Find occurrences in your Dockerfile
that look like:

```
FROM ruby:slim
```

And replace them with

```
FROM ruby:3.1.2-slim
```

And many people will do the following to make it even clearer as to what
parts may need to be tailored and what parts are fixed:

```
ARG RUBY_VERSION=3.1.2

FROM ruby:$RUBY_VERSION-slim
```

At this point, your Dockerfile may work, but eagle eyes may spot a warning that looks something
like the following:

```
Bundler 2.4.2 is running, but your lockfile was generated with 2.2.33. Installing Bundler 2.2.33 and restarting 
```

This means that while the [right thing](https://bundler.io/blog/2022/01/23/bundler-v2-3.html) was eventually done, but your build process could be improved to
use the right version in the first place.  And while node and yarn aren't as strict or as
whiny, installing the versions of these tools that you tested with will minimize surprises.

For bundler, the change looks something this:

```
ARG BUNDLER_VERSION=2.2.33
RUN gem install -N bundler -v ${BUNDLER_VERSION}
COPY . . 
RUN bundle _${BUNDLER_VERSION}_ install
```

The process for yarn is similar, and slightly simpler:

```
ARG YARN_VERSION=1.22.19
RUN npm install -g yarn@${YARN_VERSION}
```

For node, four different ways were defined, so there are four different techniques:

* nodesource: we can change `setup_current.x` to specify the major node version,
  for example `setup_18.x` for the current lts version.  It isn't possible with
  this technique to specify the minor or patch version.  If this is important to
  you, chose one of the other three alternatives.
* merging images: just as you can specify `FROM ruby:3.2.0-slim` you can specify
  `FROM node:18.13.0-slim`.  It is important to ensure that both images are
  based on the same operating system (e.g. debian vs alpine), and release
  (e.g. bullseye vs buster).  To make things clearer and avoid problems,
  include the OS release in the name, for example
  `ruby:3.2.0-slim-bullseye` and `node:18.13.0-bullseye-slim`.  Yes,
  these two projects do order the parts to this name differently.
* volta: specify the node version on the install, for
  example: `volta install node@18.13.0`.
* node as base: specify the desired node version on the FROM line, but then
  use a Ruby version manager to install the desired version of Ruby.

A few examples to demonstrate these concepts:
  * [minimal/import maps](./sources/Dockerfile1)
  * [esbuild/volta](./sources/Dockerfile2)
  * [api](./sources/Dockerfile3)

## dockerignore

While `COPY . .` is effective, it is a bit too inclusive.  For the same reason
that you have a `.gitignore` file you need a `.dockerignore` file: you don't 
want to deploy your tmp files, your test databases, your node_modules directory
or your master key.

If you don't already have one, copy your `.gitignore` file.

Now run `fly secrets list`.  If you don't see RAILS_MASTER_KEY listed there make your
master key available to your deployment image by setting a secret.  Mac and Linux
users can run the following command:

```cmd
fly secrets set RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(cat config/master.key)
```

Windows users will need to replace the `$(...)` expression with the
contents of the file.

You may already have both the `.dockerignore` file and secret set by this point
as `fly launch` will do both for you.

## binstubs

At this point you are including all of your source minus binaries, irrelevant
files, and sensitive files.

There still remains one set of files that aren't binary, are very relevant, but
may be platform specific: binstubs.

These files start with a [she bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)),
which on Windows machines may contain the letters `.exe`.  And consist of multiple
lines where the line separator is `\r` on Windows vs `\n` on Linux.  And on
Linux need to be marked executable in order to run.

For these reasons, Windows users may need lines like the following in their Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Adjust binstubs to run on Linux
RUN chmod +x /app/bin/* && \
    sed -i 's/ruby.exe\r*/ruby/' /app/bin/* && \
    sed -i 's/ruby\r*/ruby/' /app/bin/*
```
[chmod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod) can be used to set permissions and
mark files as executable.

[sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html) is a useful tool for
making string substitutions in text files.

What subset of these lines are needed, or
whether these lines are needed at all, can be determined at the time the
Dockerfile is generated.

## Recap

What started out as a seemingly simple matter - namely copying your source to the
deployment machine - turns out to require considerably more thought than most would
initially have thought.

As with before, Dockerfiles continue provide a concise way to capture these
actions and have them executed reproducibly.  That being said, there is a 
subtle shift in the reaction for many when presented with two Dockerfiles:
one that does steps you would expect to be needed in a clear and concise way,
and another that does steps that you hadn't realized were needed.

Task specific documentation like these pages are one way to address this
need.  Another is tools that not only set up Dockerfiles for you initially
but help you maintain them as you iterate on your application.
