Before proceeding, you are encouraged to read (or at least skim) the excellent
docs Fly.io provides for
[Scaling and Autoscaling](https://fly.io/docs/reference/scaling/).  Getting
the right sized machine close to your users may be enough.

Once you have settled on a machine configuration, there are a number of things
you can do to get the most out of that machine.  For each item below it is
worth benchmarking the results of the change with your application because,
as they say, your mileage may vary.

## Jemalloc

Memory allocation is key to performance, and
[jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net/) is an alternative malloc implementation.

Enabling it is a matter of adding the following to your Dockerfile:

```
RUN apt-get install libjemalloc2
ENV LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so.2
ENV MALLOC_CONF=dirty_decay_ms:1000,narenas:2,background_thread:true
```

## YJIT

A "Just In Time" compiler can make your application run faster.
Starting with Ruby 3.1,
[YJIT](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit) has been included in
the official Ruby release sources.  Using it requires a build
time option and enabling at runtime.

Unfortunately, at the present time, the official Ruby docker
image for 3.2.0 does not support YJIT
([Issue #401](https://github.com/docker-library/ruby/issues/401)).

Fortunately, [Fullstaq Ruby](https://fullstaqruby.org/) does,
and images can be found on
[Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/evl.ms/fullstaq-ruby?tab=tags&tag=latest).

```dockerfile
ARG RUBY_VERSION=3.2.0
ARG VARIANT=bullseye-slim
FROM quay.io/evl.ms/fullstaq-ruby:${RUBY_VERSION}-${VARIANT} as base
ENV RUBY_YJIT_ENABLE=1
```

You can set `VARIANT` to `jemalloc-bullseye-slim` to include jemalloc.

For those that would prefer to just get a yjit enabled ruby without
changing the base image, try either [rvm](https://rvm.io/) or
[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) which will install yjit
by default if rustc is available.

## Enabling swap

While RAM is always faster, not everything that is loaded into RAM needs 
equal treatment.  Enabling swap can allow less frequently used regions
of memory to be moved out to disk (which these days is SSD).  Running
the following commands at runtime will enable swap:

```
fallocate -l 512M /swapfile
chmod 0600 /swapfile
mkswap /swapfile
echo 10 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
swapon /swapfile
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
```

The way to incorporate these commands into your deploy is to change
the CMD (or ENTRYPOINT) of your Dockerfile to run either a rake task 
or shell script which runs these commands then starts your server.

## Recap

While the number of "one size fits all" deployment optimizations are few and
far between, testing out a new configuration is generally a matter of adding
a few lines to a Dockerfile and deploying it.  This makes it easy to experiment
and find the combination that is right for your application.
