## Miminal Rails with Full Ruby Image

Create an empty directory, and place the following Dockerfile in there:

```dockerfile
<%= dockerfile("docs/rails/cookbooks/minimal/Dockerfile1") %>
```

If you've ever seen a Dockerfile before, the above seems too good to be true.  But try it.
In your new directory run `flyctl launch`.
Accept all the defaults, then run `flyctl deploy`, followed by `flyctl open`.

Congratulations, you've deployed a Rails app.  True, it doesn't do much, but we will
add more later.

Now let's review that file.  The first line is a
[syntax directive](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/dockerfile-frontend/).  All
dockerfiles should have this.  In fact, this example wouldn't work without it as it
uses here docs.

The next line, `FROM ruby`, specifies a base image.  A base image contains a completely
preconfigured operating system along with selected other packages.  You can find
the definition for the ruby image on [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby).

Next up is two `RUN` statements.  The commands you see there should be familiar:
`gem install rails` and `rails new demo`.  `RUN` statements are run on the build
machine.

Then comes a `COPY` statement.  This statement uses a
[heredoc](https://www.docker.com/blog/introduction-to-heredocs-in-dockerfiles/)
which pretty much are the same thing as
[heredoc in Ruby](https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/11/ruby-heredoc/).  The effect
of these three lines will be to replace `config/routes.rb` with a route that
shows the Rails welcome page.

`WORKDIR` and `ENV` unsurprisingly set the current working directory and
an environment variable respectively.

A note on port 8080.  By default, Rails uses port 3000.  By default, fly.io
expects port 8080.  By setting an environment variable you can control
what port Rails uses.  Alternately, you can modify the `fly.toml` file to
tell fly to monitor port 3000 instead.  Both ways work.

Finally, there is a `CMD` which is run on the deployed server as opposed to
the build server.  It is run in the specified WORKDIR with the
environment variables you set.

EZ-Peasy.  If you didn't see it working with your own eyes, it would be hard
to imagine it being this straightforward and simple.  None of the Dockerfiles
you have seen before are as clear as this, so there must be more to this
story.

## Minimal Rails with Slim Ruby Image

Scrolling by during the build was the size of the image.  That size was
948MB.  That's compressed.  That seems a bit much for a welcome splash
screen.  Large images take longer to build and longer to deploy.
Let's make the image smaller.

Returning to [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby), you can see a lot
of alternatives.  If you scan that page and find the word `slim`, you can click
on it and find the Dockerfile that was used to create that image.  That image,
in turn, is based on `bullseye`, which is the latest release of the
[Debian](https://www.debian.org/) distribution of LInux.  Knowing this is
important.

While the full `ruby` image contains everything you *might* need, including plenty
that you will never use, `ruby:slim` doesn't contain things that will be needed
to generate your demo application.  Things like `make` and `git`.

Scanning the list of [debian bullseye
packages](https://packages.debian.org/stable/allpackages) you can find
`build-essential` and `git`.  OK, at this point, I'm just kidding.  I ran a
count and found there to be 58,733 packages on that list.  The best way to find
out what you need is pasting the error message you find when you don't include
what is needed in your favorite search engine and reviewing the answer you find
on places like StackOverflow.

The way to install packages on Debian is to use a tool named
`apt-get`, so when we are done, the `FROM ruby` line gets replaced with the following:

```dockerfile
FROM ruby:slim

RUN apt-get update &&\
    apt-get install --yes build-essential git
```

Note that this time we opted to use a single RUN statement, and use the shell `&&`
operator to run the second command only if the preceding one completed.  This
is a common technique you will find in Dockerfiles and it marginally makes the
images smaller as two separate steps are combined into one.

All in all not *too* bad.  Not exactly novice friendly, but still fairly concise.

Concise, and effective.  With this one change we got the image size down from 948MB to 520MB,
a 45% reduction.  Not bad.

But we can do even better.

## Multi-stage build

Build tools are only needed at build time, they don't need to be included in the deployed image.

This is accomplished by building two images.  In the first one we build the necessary build tools.  We then start fresh with a new image,
copy over the necessary files from the first image and then proceed on from there.
We can use [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) to do that.

This is easier than it sounds.  You put multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile, optionally
providing aliases to some images with an `as` keyword, and then use the `--from` flag on
your COPY commands.  Seeing it in action helps.  Start by adding `as build` to the existing
FROM command, then add the following immediately after the `RUN rails new demo` line:

```dockerfile
FROM ruby:slim

COPY --from=build /demo /demo
COPY --from=build /usr/local/bundle /usr/local/bundle
```

Your deployed application will contain your demo application as well as all of the
necessary gems, but none of the build tools used to create the application.  The
compressed image size is now down to 209MB.  While still substantial, this is
a dramatic 78% improvement over where we started.

At this point you might be wondering where `/usr/local/bundle` came from.  Where
bundler places installed gems is operating system specific, and can be overridden
by setting the `GEM_HOME` environment variable.  Bundler has a
[docker guide](https://bundler.io/guides/bundler_docker_guide.html#dockerfiles-for-multiple-ruby-applications-and-gems)
that provides more information.

## Recap

A recap of the progress so far.  The entire Dockerfile isn't that big:

```dockerfile
<%= dockerfile("docs/rails/cookbooks/minimal/Dockerfile3") %>
```

A total of 23 lines, 7 of them blank.

The docker portions (FROM, RUN, COPY, WORKDIR, ENV, CMD) are
very straightforward, even including advanced techniques
such as multi-stage builds and here docs.

The parts that need explaining are the operating system
parts: `apt-get`, `pkg-config`, `/usr/local/bundle`,
and `8080`.  This will remain true as you continue your
journey: the hard part isn't learning Docker, but rather
getting to know what for many of you is an entirely new
operating system.

In this case, the operating system is Debian, but Alpine
is common, and you will occasionally see member of
the RedHat family (Centos, Fedora) as well as others.

Docker files make working with these operating systems easy,
but do nothing to hide them.

To be fair, there still is a bit more to learn about
Dockerfiles, but mostly the above statement will
continue to be true.
